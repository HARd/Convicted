character0_end = Breaking! Convicted Thief Escapes \nFrom a Max Security Facility
character0_middle = As we were informed this morning, a convict serving time in a strict-regime labour camp the East Castle escaped from the facility under unknown circumstances. The convict's name is Edward Boyd, his record includes robbery with break-ins. Our source confirmed Boyd has never been a well-conducted inmate. While serving his sentence he got a reputation of a wrongdoer, breaking numerous prison rules regularly. As a result, Boyd was sent to SHU on a regular basis. Among the most frequent violations were fights with other inmates, alcohol consumption, verbal insulting of the prison administration and stealing from fellow inmates. Detectives are now investigating if Boyd prepared the escape alone or was assisted by an accomplice.
character0_quote = "Criminals like him should be isolated from our society"

Villagers near the East Castle are recommended not to let strangers into their houses and not to talk to people they don't know. If you have noticed a a suspicious character, call 911 or a local sheriff directly. 
character1_end = The East Castle warden has been brutally murdered by one of the convicts!
character1_middle = More and more distressing news keep on coming from East Castle. It was announced earlier, that one of the convicts escaped from the supermax prison.  As we have just been informed, another crime took place the same night in the same prison: one of the convicts murdered the prison warden, Bob Wiglet. A Mexican, called Carlos Luke, got into Wiglet's office and caused him fatal injuries in the neck with a plastic shiv, which the convict had crafted before, using off-the-shelf materials. The criminal was motivated by the personal dislike, caused by Luke's conflict with the prison administration. Luke made several attempts to organise the prison drug trade. All Luke's actions were repeatedly surpressed by the prison administration and by Bob Wiglet in particular.
character1_quote = "Bob Wiglet's death is an irreversible loss."
character1_left = Carlos Luke was shot dead with two shots in the chest by the security chief Duglas Turner. "I join my colleagues in expressing our sincere condolences to the family of the deceased",noted Turner.
character1_right = The head of the trade union of entrepreneurs Joshua Johnson addressed local authorities with a suggestion to announce the official mourning period in view of Bob Wiglet's tragic death. Sources tell us that Wiglet and Johnson were close friends.

47 = Frank pressed on some pressure points on my back and that eased the pain. Damn it’s good that he’s my friend around here.
48 = I was in the showers when it came to me that I could snatch some soap while nobody was looking. If the guards don’t notice I can easily get along with it. It’s weird though that we are not allowed to have our own soap. I need to fix that.
49 = I can try to snatch a plastic fork after I finish my meal. I can make a good shiv out of it. If only I could steal it without the guards noticing.
50 = I decided to leave it as it is. I don’t need any more problems with the screws.

154 = Steal the scissors
155 = Learn the prison slang
156 = I knocked the bastard on the ground and started bashing his brains out. The guards piled on me like we were on a football match. I was thrown to the solitary but even there I couldn’t calm down. Yeah, I had a bad day.

170 = I recall trying to calm down with breathing techniques. A moment later I was already holding the guy's throat. The guards showed up just in time before I choked him to death. I got knocked out and woke up in the SHU.
171 = ""
172 = I tried to intimidate him but he seems to be a hard fella. Either I let it go or I’ll have to do this the hard way.
173 = The dumb bastard is still holding his own. I’ll have to deal with him the hard way around or let it slide.
174 = I walked to the chiefs office to get some work for today. There are a couple of options:
175 = Someone trashed almost a full bottle of bleach. Maybe I should keep it?
176 = The fella made a big mistake refusing to pay up. He might be a tough guy but I’m a freaking bull. After I was over with him, the rest paid up as soon as we showed up.
177 = I need to be more fit and have a better reputation amongst the guards to work in the laundry.\n\n[ Requirements: Body 30, Guard reputation 10 ]
178 = Cleaning up shit after everybody might not seem the best job in the world but it has it’s uses. I was able to sneak to another inmate’s cell unnoticed. I can look around and snatch anything useful if I want to.
179 = The tough guy didn’t listen to common sense and my hints on what was gonna happen to him. I left him lying in his cell in his own blood and continued with my toll collecting. Others who have witnessed the incident paid up like a charm so by the end of the day me and my buddies had a nice load of cigs.
180 = A bunch of inmates armed with shanks showed up while I was going to my cell. I need to defend my life here and now!
181 = Total power
182 = Damn it, I’m pissed off already and this idiot just had to be in my way. I’m going to rip him apart!
183 = They kept beating the crap out of me while I was on the floor but they couldn’t make me pay. Someone helped me get to my cell and I spent a couple of hours before I could even reach for the sink. My cellmates were kind of impressed that I haven’t backed off but my ribs still hurt..
184 = I decided to snoop around to get some more details about the hit. They haven’t noticed me poking near their cell so I was able to hear the whole story. Now I have to decide the fate of the victim. Should I alert the guards or the victim?
185 = I was on my way to my cell when some thug caught me by surprise and dragged me to a small storeroom. I found myself surrounded by a bunch of inmates and the bastard who recently tried to shake me down for cigs.\n - I told you, you’re gonna regret this, fool, - their leader looked at me with a grim smile on his face. 
186 = I need to have more wits and get a better reputation amongst the guards if I want to work in the kitchen.\n\n[ Requirements: Mind 60, Guard reputation 60]
187 = While I was politely explaining to a bunch of inmates that they owed me some cigs, a giant tattooed prick showed up and started yelling that it was his turf and nobody else was gonna milk it.
188 = Me and my cellmates were able to shake a ton of cigs from other inmates. Now I must decide how we share it.
189 = I tried to knock out their leader but I slightly overrated myself. He was stronger than me so I took a beating. I took some more before the guards were able to intervene and save my ass. I woke up in the solitary. I felt like I was rammed by a train but at least I had the guts to stand up against them.
190 = How about I play a game of pool? Maybe I can even win some cigs if I place a bet.
191 = I was carrying a broken mop to the trash bins when it stroke me that I could make it into a nice club. Not that anyone is going to miss a broken mop anyway, yeah?
192 = I need to have more wits and get a better reputation amongst the guards if I want to work in the kitchen.\n\n[ Requirements: Mind 30, Guard reputation 10]
193 = I tried to snoop around and get some more details and who was gonna be wacked but they noticed and changed the subject. Now I hope they didn’t think I’m a snitch or somethin.
194 = I was minding my own business when a bunch of tough guys showed up. They’re telling me that I owe them some cigs. There are no guards around so either I pay up or there’s going to be a fight.
195 = One of the inmates asks me for a favor. He wants me to craft a shank while I’m working on my shift in workshop. Might be dangerous but a serious amount of cigs is involved.
196 = I need to get hooked up or I’ll be pretty much crawling on the walls soon...
197 = He was stronger than me and knocked me out as soon as I rushed him. He held me on the floor waiting for the guards to show up. I was still trying to kick him even when they were dragging me out of there. I even bit a guard. They threw me in solitary but even there it took me some time to calm down. 
198 = I got a pretty bright idea on how to ease my work in workshop. I hope I won’t spoil the stuff instead.
199 = One of the other inmates ruined a uniform while ironing it. The screws told me to trash it. Maybe I should keep it?
200 = Some shmuck is asking me to lend him some cigs. Don’t know if I should.
201 = I was on my way to my cell when I overheard some thug talking about murdering a guy from the other block. The guy’s gonna be dead tomorrow.
202 = I offered him a cut of what we collected but he just laughed at me. He wants it all.
203 = A pair of scissors broke when I was working in the library. The screws ordered me to trash them. Maybe I should keep them?
204 = I found a kitchen knife behind the fridge. Hah! Seems like nobody’s ever known it’s out there. The screws surely won’t be looking for it if I take it. If only I could sneak it out of here.
205 = Who are you gonna  call? Ghostbusters!
206 = I tried to snoop around to get more details but the thugs changed the subject and I couldn’t get anything more. Seems I’ve got nothing.
207 = I was able to sneak up to the fence unnoticed. I can cut off some wire with scissors or shears. I’ll think about how to use it later.
208 = I need a drink fast. I hope some whiskey can lighten up my life in this shithole.
209 = One of the bastards is refusing to pay up. He seems like a tough guy but if I let it slide I’ll lose my reputation.
210 = I told a guard I had a matter to discuss with him.
211 = Some thugs showed up right in front of me. Their leader, a tough looking schmuck, is telling me that I owe him. I either pay up or I’ll get beaten. The screws are keeping an eye on us but I can try to knock out the bastard, nobody else will interfere.
212 = The haggler has nothing for me today. Sucks!
213 = I finished my meal and hid a plastic fork in my pocket. The guards hadn’t noticed and I was able to sneak it out.
214 = I tried to calm down but the next moment I was lying on the floor with this hulk on top of me. The screws saw that it was me who started the fight and decided to keep me locked up in the SHU.
215 = I called my relatives and heard the bad news.
216 = Shit didn’t go smooth this time. The bastard beat the hell out of me in a second. My goons interfered and he got the same but I’ve lost my reputation of a badass. Others weren’t kean on paying up after this as well so we didn’t get a lot on this raid.
217 = I was able to snatch a pack of cigs from another inmate’s cell. I may be a rat but I’m a rat with cigs now. I finished my shift and went straight to my cell.
218 = I hid in my cell and got as high as the heavens. I spent a couple of hours in my bed and realised that things aren’t so bad after all. It turned out to be the last pack of dope that I had though.
219 = I tried to snatch a plastic fork after I finished with my meal but one of the screws busted me and took it away. Gave me a nice punch in the face as well. Asshole.
220 = I asked the guards to pass the figurine as a gift to the Warden. Later one of them told me that he was very pleased. Though other inmates were looking at me like I kissed his ass or somethin.
221 = I called my friend on the outside and he agreed to visit me.
222 = I tried to sneak past the guards with a metal strip in my pocket but they happened to search me before I could leave. They found the metal I was carrying but I found my way around it by fooling them. They confiscated the metal strip but I didn’t end up in the SHU. I need to be more careful next time anyway.
223 = A gorilla-like screw pushed me to the wall: "Show me your pockets inmate! I saw a shank in your hands!", he was yelling right in my face. He had a strange stench coming out of his mouth like a bunch of vermin died there.
224 = I cut my arm while I was working my shift in the workshop. Had to finish my shift early and get to the infirmary. Still hurts.
225 = I was able to stay cool and calm down. Yelling at him did actually help. It’s better than spending time in the SHU.
226 = I got nervous and let it slide this time. I gave him everything we scraped together so far and now my cellmates seem really disappointed. So am I.
227 = Get a pair of scissors
228 = I walked straight out of there not even listening. Maybe someone will die tomorrow but it’s not my business. More a con, less a con, who cares anyways?
229 = I decided to rest a while in my cell. I remembered that I took a book from the library. I’ve spent the day reading and felt much better. I actually felt myself smarter after reading. At least it seemed to me.
230 = I got beaten for real and after that he took everything I had. My mates were disappointed but at least I tried to stand up in a fight and didn’t let it slide easily.
231 = The showers were stuffed like a can of sardines and a bunch of inmates were standing in line. One of the inmates saw me and let me take his place in the line. Nothing better than a nice hot shower. The screws weren’t happy about me bullying other inmates though.
232 = I went to the common room and was just in time for my favorite TV show. I was able to rest a little while watching it.
233 = With no smokes around I get real itchy. Either I drop this shit or I need to get a pack and a lighter.
234 = An old friend of mine from the outside visited me here. We talked about recent business and other stuff. At the end of visitation time he passed me a small package with some goods in it and I was able to sneak it in.
235 = After a while the guard returned with a plastic bottle. It had beer in it though the taste was like he pissed in it. Anyway that was something and it cheered me up.
236 = Shaking down the block didn’t give much. We were able to scrape together a couple of bucks but that was it. Me and my mates were a bit pissed but there’s nothing we could do about it. We need to get more authority here.
237 = Turned out that he wasn’t fooling around afterall. I took some beating and my goons had to intervene. The rest didn’t pay up after my deal with this guy.
238 = call_relatives_big_success
239 = Security Chief
240 = I let it slide this time and told him he would regret it later. Others saw what happened and refused to pay up after this. I think my goons aren’t confident in my reputation anymore as well.
241 = "Damn, I need cigs fast. Alright, chill. I’ll think of something. Thanks anyway", he then went to talk to an another group of inmates. Looks like he really needs them.
242 = An old friend of mine from the outside visited me here. We talked about recent business and other stuff. At the end of visitation time he passed me a small package with some goods in it and I was able to sneak it in.
243 = I took over the cooking process and offered to cook something special not the usual crap we fed others with. It took some time and effort but we managed to cook a delicious meal. I think others from the block will be surprised by the treat.
244 = I kicked their asses real good this time and now nobody’s going to mess with me.
245 = I agreed to help him and made a nice shank during my shift. The screws were busy playing cards so they hadn’t noticed anything and I was able to sneak it out of the workshop and got my payment. Beautiful.
246 = I was working in the laundry till the evening. The stench of bleach and dirty clothes made me a bit sick in the end but luckily I’m fit enough not to drop on the floor from that shit.
247 = I’ve talked to the guards a bit and they don’t seem that bad after all. And anyone thinking I’m kissing their asses can go screw themselves.
248 = I went out unnoticed to the yard and sterted walking along the fence. Some time later I noticed a package. There was whiskey in it.
249 = The guards searched me but didn’t find anything. Fools.
250 = Fetch an item
251 = It was easy enough to cut a small wire with the shears I had with me. This could be useful.
252 = "Perfect. Talk to me when it’s done. I’ll be waiting", he went to mind some other business.
253 = I was clumsy enough to cut myself with a knife while I was working in the kitchen. Doc said it would take a while to heal.
254 = I had a bet with some bull in the yard that I could do 100 push ups. Didn’t even break a sweat and earned my 5 cigs.
255 = I decided that I should keep the bigger share to myself. Others didn’t argue but seems like they have a different opinion.
256 = I took over the cooking process and offered to cook something special not the usual crap we fed others with. Didn’t go well and the meal wasn’t looking pretty either. Now I hope nobody’s going to notice the difference from the usual shit.
257 = The guards didn’t lay their eyes off me so I wasn’t able to craft the shank I promised. Maybe someone tipped them off?
258 = I’ve snatched the bottle of bleach and hid it in my clothes. The screws didn’t even notice anything.
259 = I need to have a drink, goddamn it, or I’ll smash someone’s head to bits instead.
260 = I came to the common room to have a rest but there was only some shitty TV show that the others were eager to watch. More ads than show if you ask me. Anyway I was bored and didn’t rest that much.
261 = I came to talk to one of the guards and reported to him about the murder. I couldn’t tell him the name of the victim or anything about. He just ignored me but the others heard we talked and are thinking I’m a snitch now.
262 = Showers were stuffed like a can of sardines and a bunch of inmates were standing in line. I threw out of the shower the first loser that I got my hands on. He made a wise decision not to mess with me and scrammed. I took a nice hot shower but I didn’t like the look of guards when I was leaving. 
263 = Shit. I accidently messed up one of guards uniform. I didn’t get paid for the shift but at least the screws didn’t beat the crap out of me.
264 = I took some time watching others play ball and learned some new stuff. Doesn’t make me stronger but knowing some dirty tricks is always useful.
265 = I decided to work like I always do without any experiments. I went straight to my cell after my shift was over.
266 = I called my fellas about the contraband.
267 = Turned out they didn’t really like my cooking. Everyone knew that I had a shift in the kitchen today and someone spread the word that it was my idea. I caught some really unpleasent looks out there. The picky fucks.
268 = "Whatever. You know where to find me if you change your mind"
269 = Working in the library is like having a vacation and I getting paid for it. Just sort the books and answer dumb questions on where to find them. Much better than janitor or laundry work.
270 = I spent some time trying to cut the fence with the scissors but it turned out to be much harder than I expected. In the end I broke my scissors so it seemed like I wasn't getting any wire  that day for sure.
271 = I played ball with other cons the whole day. At the end of the day I was feeling tired like a dog but stronger than a bull.
272 = I survived the fight. Someone is going to have to clean the blood from the walls.
273 = Make a play
274 = One of the inmates gave me his desert when I finished my meal in the canteen. Respect can only be earned.

579 = Leave

651 = A formal appeal by the book is better in my opinion. It wasn’t easy to do it right but I managed to pull it off. I handed it to the guards but they just shrugged their shoulders. There was nothing to pick at and the other inmates liked it.

656 = I told him that I wasn't that good at writing and went off minding my own business.

1080 = "Easy, bro. First of all, find the netsuke owners and prove that Eddie Boyd is the best thief in the city." I heard short dial tones. The bastard had hung up on me! Seems I have no choice. I'm back to business.
1081 = Search for Cat netsuke
1082 = In prison, like in life, the cat is out of the bag, always. It's hard to keep a secret. If I want to know the whereabouts of the netsuke, I have to [green]talk to other inmates[/green], [green]wander around the block[/green] and keep my eyes and ears wide open.
1083 = I heard a convict telling about a man named Fang, who works in the canteen. On Friday night Fang had gotten a lucky hand of cards, winning a statuette of a cat. Seems like it's exactly what I'm looking for!
1084 = Go to the canteen
1085 = I decided to go to the canteen and ask inmates about Fang. Breakfast had just ended, there were hardly any inmates left in the canteen. I need to figure out what Fang looks like and check whether he has the netsuke.
1086 = Ask convicts in the canteen
1087 = Look around room at the convicts
1088 = I saw a dejected fatso. That's an ideal candidate for questioning. I can try to ask him about Fang.
1089 = Start speaking politely
1090 = The fatso said he was a newcomer. He said I should ask the thug sitting in a corner of the canteen. 
1091 = Intimidate him with a fork
1092 = I quietly approached fatso. When the guards were looking the other way, I pressed him against the wall and threatened him with a fork, making my voice sound as menacing as possible.
1093 = Who is Fang?
1094 = What do you know about the Cat netsuke?
1095 = Fatso started mumbling, so I realized he knew nothing. Poor fellow. 
1096 = Fatso was paralyzed with fright. He was about to burst into tears. At this point, I felt wretched or what I was doing to him. But I felt justified since my wife’s life was on the line.
1097 = Push the fork harder into his gut.
1098 = The fatso started to beg me not to kill him. Judging from the look in his eye I'd say, he is about to tell me everything.
1099 = Put the fork away and listen
1100 = In a quavery voice fatso whispered: "Fang is a nickname of Zach, the chef in the kitchen. You'll know him by the lion's claw on his neck. "
1101 = Give Fatso 5 cigs
1102 = Give Fatso 10 cigs
1103 = Say 'thanks' and tap him on the shoulder
1104 = I gave Fatso cigs and tapped him on the shoulder. Well, now I know who Fang is! I had noticed the lion's claw on Zach's neck before, but simply didn't think about it. Now, I must find the other two figurines.
1105 = Well, now I know who Fang is! Thanks, fatso, you may go now. I need to figure out who possesses the other two figurines.
1106 = Use a trick
1107 = I realized I could apply the tactics of "Beating not to be beaten." The idea is to go to the canteen and throw down a challenge to Fang. I need a cockroach to make my plan work perfectly.
1108 = I need to catch a cockroach
1109 = I figured out I could find cockroaches in the garbage cans. But to get them, I need to get access. I think the easiest way is to get some work in the kitchen.
1110 = Go to the canteen
1111 = A hefty thug, called Zach, was in charge of the kitchen. He had huge paws and the neck of a bull. So, better not to quarrel with someone like Zach.
1112 = Work as a bean
1113 = Zach quickly endorsed my candidacy. My first job was to take out the trash. As I was busy near the garbage cans, I managed to find a hole that may someday help me get out of here. 
1114 = Catch a cockroach
1115 = I managed to catch a hefty cockroach. Then I pulled off my sock, put my new whiskered pal inside and put the sock in my belt. 
1116 = Go back to the kitchen
1117 = While convicts were busy, I quietly threw the cockroach into my bowl of soup.
1118 = Make a scene
1119 = I was brawling for half an hour, but inmates didn't bat an eye. Seems like I lack charisma. I should [green] learn the prison slang [/green] or [green] go to drama class [/green].
1120 = The shit hit the fan. The sparks began to fly! Everybody came runining over, even that old one-legged convict from laundry room. When there were enough people around I said: "That's Fang's fault!"
1121 = Play dead
1122 = Stand your ground
1123 = Zach came from the kitchen pushing his way through the crowd with his paws. He leaned over me, glared at me and hissed: "You have a complaint, scum?"
1124 = Throw a challenge
1125 = Hush up
1126 = Zach lifted my ass off the chair, and punched me in the jaw, knocking me out cold. I pulled myself together in my cell, my head was bursting from the blow. Now I need to find out who has the other two figurines.
1127 = I noticed a hefty fellow with a tattoo of a dragon on his back. Harry said that one of the figurines was taken by force. Perhaps this big fellow had something to do with this story. 
1128 = Go to the gym
1129 = The gym was stuffy and smelled of sweat. Is there anybody who ever comes here voluntarily? I need tolook around. 
1130 = Walk through the gym
1131 = I saw that guy with the dragon tattoo. He was puffing and blowing benching the bar. The bar buckled under the impressive weight of discs. What strength!
1132 = Wait untill he finishes
1133 = Hide and watch him
1134 = The big guy finished his exercises and went to shower. I started to ponder over my next move. Even if this bully has nothing to do with the figurines, it would be useful to somehow get his help.
1135 = Come up to the bar
1136 = There was a notebook lying next to it. The big thug in a clumsy handwriting recorded how many times and how much weight he benched today. According to the records, he always starts his workouts with a bench press.
1137 = I heard a rustle and quickly turned around. Carlos was standing behind me. Seems like the Mexican saw me digging in Dan's belongings. "Do you want to slay Hulking Dan?", Carlos asked.
1138 = What if we cut a piece of rebar Hulking Dan uses to hang his heavy bar? Then fasten it with a duct tape. When he finishes the exercise and tries to place the bar on it, it will fall right on his head!
1139 = Does it bother you? 
1140 = No, why? 
1141 = "If you cut a piece of rebar Hulking Dan uses to hang his heavy bar, it will fall right on his head as soon as he tries to put the bar back on the stand! Comprende? " Carlos winked at me and headed for the exit.
1142 = Search for Dragon netsuke
1143 = It would be nice to gain some weight, coz some convicts still call me 'the whimp'. It's difficult to obtain information when the cons don’t respect you. So, early in the morning I can[green] go jogging[/green], [green]go to the playground[/green] or [green]work out at the gym[/green].
1144 = Now I have everything to blend right in with this thug and a bar, so I need to know the exact time when he comes to the gym. I decided to follow him.
1145 = Follow Hulking Dan
1146 = I came across the thug right next to the gym. He was standing there with some skinny looking dude and blabbered about life.
1147 = Sneak up a bit closer
1148 = Get around back
1149 = I was close enough to hear the conversation. Dan was telling how he was used to going to the gym every day at 10 am. He demanded that the skinny guy clean his clothes after his every visit to the gym.  
1150 = Sneak into the gym
1151 = Slightly open the gym door
1152 = Fine. I'll return as soon as I rustle up some cigs.
1153 = The gym was empty. I can start now. I approached the bench, took out the pincers and cut the rebar with great effort. I hate myself for doing this but it's the only way to save my wife.
1154 = Get the duct tape
1155 = Check if no one's coming
1156 = I carefuly rolled up the cut a segment of a rebar with the duct tape. I also attached the duct tape on the other side of a rebar as well to make it look symmetrical. It was then when I heard the sound of heavy footsteps in the hallway.
1157 = Hide in the shower
1158 = Hide in the locker room
1159 = Suddenly the door flew open and I saw Hulking Dan strolling inside the gym. He was waving his giant arms doing his warm-ups. Should my plan fail he'll break my spine with these very arms. I waited for Dan to get to the barbell.
1160 = Peek through the keyhole
1161 = Hulking Dan held the barbell on his outstreched arms. He slowly pulled it to his chest and then pushed it back with a pant. I started counting every push: one… two…
1162 = Leave the hiding shelter on the 8th push
1163 = Leave the shelter on the 10th push
1164 = Leave the shelter on the 12th push
1165 = I could barely move my feet because of anxiety. My vision was blurred. I got to Hulking Dan right when the barbell was falling on his head. I saw the horror in his eyes.
1166 = Hold the barbell
1167 = Throw the barbell on the floor
1168 = At first Dan didn't grasp what happened. He then burst out with anger and started hurling weights around the gym. While he swore to tear apart whoever was behind this, I saw a netsuke on his neck. It was a Dragon on a leather strap.
1169 = Calm Dan down
1170 = Sit quietly and wait
1171 = Finally, Dan calmed down a bit. He walked over to me and and reached out his hand. "Thanks, bro! They call me Hulking Dan".
1172 = Boyd
1173 = I'm Eddie. You're lucky I was nearby
1174 = So, I managed to become a bro with the owner of the second netsuke. Now I just have to find the owner of the third one.
1175 = Look for the Rat netsuke
1176 = While playing cards I learned about the prison Vegas. A true gambler's heaven. I concluded that a lot of dough can be made there. Plus it will be a perfect opportunity to find the third netsuke! I should [green]make a play[/green] in the evening and play some cards! 
1177 = The winning streak in Vegas gave me a huge amount of cigs! One guy decided to play big and staked 60 cigs. Perhaps, If I'm lucky enough I'll find something about the third netsuke.
1178 = Play big!
1179 = I need to hoard some cigs first
1180 = I'll pass
1181 = Schmucks took me to a closet near the kitchen where some big fish had already been waiting for me. I took a seat at the table and the bossy looking fella started dealing the cards.
1182 = I noticed a scrawny guy in front of me who was fiddling with the rat figurine he was holding in his hands. It was the third netsuke! The scrawny guy looked me in the eyes, his mouth grinned. "A charm I won not so long ago. Brings me luck."
1183 = We started playing but I ran out of cigs pretty fast. These scammers outdid me really taking me to the cleaners! At least I know who's got the third netsuke and so far it seems the only way to get it is to win it from Scrawny.
1184 = Finally I got my turn to use the phone booth. Having made sure no one was listening, I dialed Harry's number. There was no answer from the other side for a while but then I suddenly heard…
1185 = "Hey, bro? Haven't heard from you in a while. Your wife and the rest of us had started to get real anxious, you know."
1186 = I know who's got netsuke
1187 = Let me talk to my wife!
1188 = "I knew we could count on you. Now the only thing you've got to do is to steal those figurines, bring them to me and I’ll release your woman. Hell, I'll even top it off with some dough for your trouble. Anyway, I'll send a courier to ya tomorrow."
1189 = "Easy, man. She's having a ball. Now the only thing you've got to do is to steal those figurines, bring them to me and I'll release your woman. Hell, I'll even top it off with some dough for your trouble. Anyway, I'll send a courier to ya tomorrow."
1190 = Make the rules
1191 = Explain about the 3 figurines
1192 = "Listen, Harry… If I just steal those figurines then I'm a goner. I need to come up with an escape plan first, only then I'll do the deed. After I get out we'll conduct the exchange."
1193 = "Ok bro, have it your way. But keep in mind that you're running out of time. I'll send your wife to you piece by piece should you let me down."
1194 = Think back and remember what happened before

1204 = While working, I got the opportunity to snatch some pincers.
1205 = Steal the pincers.
1206 = I managed to hide the pincers in my uniform. Guards didn't notice anything, and didn't even think of searching me when I was leaving the workshop.
1207 = I tried to sneak out the pincers in a small box but the guards decided to search me thoroughly on my way out. I played dumb and said that I must have forgotten to put them away. I managed to avoid punishment but I've got to be more careful from now on.
1208 = While walking in the yard I saw something in the grass near the fence. After getting closer I noticed it was a phone card. This would definitely come in handy.
1209 = Make friends with Dan
1210 = To pull off this trick with Hulking Dan. I'll need a pair of pincers and some duct tape. I can buy some duct tape if I [green]go to the Haggler[/green]. As for the pincers, I gotta [green]sign up for prison labour[/green] as a janitor and then try to steal them from the closet.
1211 = Look for a phone card
1212 = If I wanna call Harry I'll need a phone card. Perhaps I should [green]talk with inmates[/green] or [green]hang around the prison[/green] a bit more if I want to find out where to get one.
1213 = Chance
1214 = Carlos continued: "They call me "Stashes". Obviously it's because I know how to get in and hide contraband. That's what I did outside and that's what I continue doing inside."
1215 = Eddie
1216 = Eddie Boyd. Jewelry stealing
1217 = "Well, buddy, make yourself comfortable. From what I know officer Turner has already given you a brief on what's what."
1218 = And here I am in the phone booth queue again. Some thug was screaming  into the receiver at the top of his voice, blaming his other half for hanging out with some jive ass rapper. Eventually he hung up the phone and boogied on out. I picked up the handset and dialed Harry's number.
1219 = Harry?
1220 = Harry was stretching out words in his mocking manner as usual: "Hi there, Eddie. Sarah and I were thinking you wooldn't call us any more. Have you got any joyous news to share?"
1221 = Everything's done
1222 = I'm getting out soon
1223 = "Listen closely, my friend. The moment you're out of prison run straight to the road. There will be a cliff on your way which you'll have to get around using the trail on the northern side. When you get down run to the road again: my man will be waiting for you in a car there. He'll get you to Sarah."
1224 = Cops will be on the lookout for me
1225 = I'll need new ID's
1226 = "Chill out, bro: I've got a fresh pair of fake ID's waiting for you and your wife. Both of you will get to Canada at my expense. Just get me those netsuke and we're even."
1227 = I hung up the phone and went to my cell. All I could think of was Sarah and the way I could steal the netsukes from the inmates. When I got to the crib Carlos glanced at me as if he knew what was going on in my head. 
1228 = Steal the cat netsuke
1229 = I was thinking about the best means of getting to the Fang's stash.  My choice fell on "knock him out while he's at the kitchen" way. He's quite a big guy so I'll need a whole bottle of whiskey and a pack of dope. If I mix them up it'll be enough to knock out a raging bull. I might as well buy both whiskey and the dope if I [green]go to the Haggler[/green].
1230 = Mix whiskey with the dope
1231 = I'll leave it for later
1232 = I got a splendid cocktail by mixing whiskey with some strong dope. Now I need to get this stuff to Fang. 
1233 = Head for the kitchen

1235 = Put the bottle of sleeping booze on the table
1236 = Pour the sleeping booze in their cups
1237 = "Damn, bro!" exclaimed the surprised inmates. They emptied their cups in no time and shortly afterwards the whole gang was lying on the floor snoring. 
1238 = I need to act fast and find where he's hiding the netsuke.
1239 = Ransack Fang's pockets. 
1240 = I ransacked Fang's pockets but found nothing. I need to search further as time is running out.

1242 = There was a big safe on the closet's floor. I inspected it and it became clear that I wouldn't be able to open it without a key.
1243 = Examine the "Lion's Fang" pendant

1245 = Run to the closet
1246 = I inserted the key into the safe and turned it, my hands were shaking with anxiety. With every turn my heartbeat increased as well. Having opened the door I noticed the cat netsuke amid the papers. 
1247 = I went back to my cell, holding the cat netsuke in my hand. On my way I stumbled upon a white-haired inmate named Paulson. Some time ago I heard from one guy that Paulson was a squealer. I need to be careful now.
1248 = I need to get ready before going on such a serious job.
1249 = Cat netsuke
1250 = Dragon netsuke
1251 = Rat netsuke

1253 = I know his number by heart already. When I get outside the first thing I'm gonna do is get rid of this tattoo, but for now I need to deal with all of this crap.
1254 = Listening to the ringtone felt like an eternity. At last someone picked up the phone on the other side. "It's Boyd" I said. 
1255 = "I hope you were a good boy, Eddie?" I closed my eyes as I imagined hitting Harry's satisfied face. This thought alone made me smile. "I've got the goods" I replied. 
1256 = We stick to the plan? 
1257 = How's Sarah?
1258 = "You know that I'm a man of my word. A black Dodge will be waiting for you. Behave yourself with the driver: he's a bit edgy. And he doesn't like surprises either..."
1259 = There'll be no surprises
1260 = I'm a man of my word too 
1261 = "Good, Eddie, very good! It'll be over soon. I have my trust in you." Harry hanged up the phone. I took some time listening to the busy tone thinking about how my wife's life depended on that bastard. 
1262 = But this nightmare will be over soon. I just need to break out of this prison.  
1263 = Start the jailbreak 
1264 = It seems my adventures in this prison are coming to an end. I just need to wait till the night comes so I can escape undetected. 
1265 = I decided to check my stash but Lil' Johnny was hanging out nearby, so I had to wait till he went off. Once I was alone I wrapped the figurines in a rag and hid them under my shirt. 
1266 = I went round the car and took the front passenger's seat. 
1267 = Where's Sarah?
1268 = Put the figurines in the pocket
1269 = Harry gave a signal to one of his goons to his left, who then opened a door to one of the cars, and I saw Sarah inside. Her hands were tied, she was definitely scared but she was smiling at me. My Sarah... "Give me the netsukes, Boyd!"
1270 = Hug Sarah
1271 = What's going on?
1272 = Harry grinned. "I don't give a flying fuck 'bout these netsukes. But I do care a lot 'bout what's hidden in them." And with these words he picked up three objects from the rubble. They were portable memory cards. 
1273 = Sarah's hand slipped down my back and finding the gun. This is our only chance to make it out of here alive. "Wait! I’ve got a terrific joke about a rabbit and a jackass I want to tell you!". I felt Sarah pulling my gun ... 
1274 = Shoot Harry
1275 = Escape through the tunnel
1276 = After breaking out of East Castle, I dashed directly to the place where Harry's driver was waiting for me. I had fallen when I was going down a steep incline, slid on my belly, and cracked my head on a stone. Should I not bandage my head up?
1277 = Treat the wound
1278 = I tore off a piece from my prison uniform, quickly made a band aid, and put it onto the wound. The bleeding has stopped, and I felt I could continue running.

1281 = There were light beams ahead of me. The road was closed! I looked through the bushes and saw a black Dodge parked there. I walked over to the car. One of Harry's thugs was behind the steering wheel.
1282 = Sit in the car
1283 = Check if there's no tail
1284 = I listened carefully. Everything was quiet. No howling sirens, no shouting, no dogs barking. It seems that my disappearance went unnoticed. I got into the car.
1285 = We pulled away. My driver didn't seem to notice me. Like most people working for Harry, this one turned out to be a thug with a brick for a face. Having thought for a while, I asked:
1286 = I took the gun and pulled the trigger. But there was no shot. I pulled the trigger again and again, but there were no shots, only clicks.
1287 = Is my wife alright?
1288 = "Harry, let Sarah go. She's only guilty in saying yes to me a long time ago..."
1289 = Where are we going?
1290 = Fight to the death

1292 = I got ready to kill anyone who'd come close to me or Sarah. If we fight, they'll kill us quickly.
1293 = My driver did not even look at me. I didn’t press for answers. Soon I'll find out everything. If I stay alive, of course.
1294 = Half an hour later we arrived at an abandoned gas station. I realized that my journey was over. Not far from the old gas station there were a several non-descript cars, all Dodges and Chevrolets.   
1295 = Step out of the car
1296 = Sit back
1297 = The driver turned to me and said "Get out of here, asshole!" It looks like I don't have any other option whatsoever.
1298 = I stepped out of the vehicle and made a few steps forward. Headlights blinded me for a few seconds. I heard footsteps in front of me. It was Harry in freaking person. "Here is our man! I've missed you."
1299 = Keep netsukes
1300 = I didn't move. Harry's goons pointed their guns at me. Harry stopped smiling. "Stop fooling around, Boyd. Where are netsukes?"
1301 = Give Harry netsukes 
1302 = I fetched a roll with netsukes from my bosom and gave it to Harry. Harry snatched it away, unpacked it and burst into laughing. "Damn, Boyd, you did it! You saved my ass." Harry released Sarah and pushed her in my direction. 
1303 = I took Sarah into my arms. My heart pounded. I smelled her hair and it felt like the world had stopped. So many times I pictured this moment and dreamed of holding her in my arms like this. But it was too early to celebrate the family reunion. I took Sarah's hand and turned to Harry. 
1304 = I got the job done
1305 = Where are our papers?
1306 = Look at Harry
1307 = But Harry ignored me and put the netsukes on the ground. Then he fetched a hammer from the trunk of his car, came to the netsukes and started smashing them with the hammer.
1308 = "What the hell are you doing"
1309 = Say nothing
1310 = Harry kept on hitting the netsuked until they turned into bits and pieces. I couldn't believe my eyes. He destroyed what I 'd been risking my life for. 
1311 = What's on those cards?
1312 = I looked at Harry lying dead on the ground. He had a shell hole between his eyes. Those guys who saved us were obviously pros. But what's gonna happen to us?
1313 = What's next? Can we go?
1314 = How did those cards get into the netsukes?
1315 = "Oh Boyd... You've always been a dumbass, but this time you outdid yourself. Just do the math. Why should I keep the eyewitnesses?"  Harry said and pointed his gun at me. They say your whole life flashes before your eyes in moments like this. But I could only think of how incredibly stupid I was indeed. How could I trust a bastard like this?
1316 = Tell a parable
1317 = "There once was a hare, who did not believe that there were any hunters in the world. Only when the hare met them in the woods, he realized that they really existed. But it was too late." Harry waited for an ending, but I said nothing more. "Did you like my story, Harry?"

I knew they were gonna slaughter us at any moment. "I'm so sorry, babe", I whispered. Sarah smiled at me. "At least we tried", she said. 
1323 = Get up 
1324 = The smile vanished from Harry's face. "I planned on killing you and your chick swiftly. But I changed my mind. I'll let my boys kick back."
1325 = Try to negotiate 
1326 = Harry was about to shoot me. "Die, you piece-of-shit!" I hugged Sarah and closed my eyes...
1327 = And then something strange happened. I was deafened by the gunfire. Harry's men fell on the ground. I turned around and saw a dozen of camuflauged men coming out of woods. 
1328 = We raised our hands. One of the soldiers came to Harry and took three memory cards from his hand. "Check them!", he said to another soldier. Our eyes met. "Eddie Boyd. I've heard a lot about you", he said smiling at me. "Don't worry. Now you are safe." 
1329 = Who are you?
1330 = What's happening?
1331 = What do you want?
1332 = "Those cards contain valuable information for the people I work for. There are lots of juicy details of some prominent the public officials covering criminals like this one", the Commander pointed at Harry. "Almost everyone who investigated this case was murdered. But we plan on bringing this info to public."
1333 = Steal the dragon figurine
1334 = To get the dragon figurine I'll need a distraction, a pair of scissors and a little bit of luck. Scissors are no problem. I need to go to [green]work in the library [/green] and I'll be able to steal scissors from there. But how can I possibly make Hulking Dan not notice my cutting off the figurine from his neck? I've noticed Hulking Dan getting special meals in the canteen. I gotta find out why. I should go to [green]work in the kitchen[/green].
1335 = I've gotta recruit an accomplice. Carlos seems a suitable candidate. I need to talk to him. If I [green]talk to other inmates[/green] they will tell me where he is.
1336 = Persuade Carlos
1337 = "This shit is dangerous, mi amigo. If you want me to risk my ass for you, you'll have to pay. I'll take 50 cigs for that." Of course I didn't want to say goodbye to my cigarettes, but I didn't have any other option.
1338 = Pay him
1339 = ""
1340 = I don't know how he did it, but in a couple of hours my partner fetched me a protein bar containing nuts. There is no one like Carlos when it comes to contraband. Dan won't be able to say no to such a treat.
1341 = Now I need to figure out when and where I should do it. I think the gym is the right place.  
1342 = Make sure Carlos is in
1343 = Carlos told me he would be in the gym in the [green]evening[/green] after 6 p.m. My fingers are crossed that everything will go smoothly! 
1344 = Looks like I have no choice
1345 = We shook hands and Carlos went away. Honestly, I didn't like this plan, but there weren't too many options. I was running out of time. Someone could easily discover my tunnel. 
1346 = I went to the gym. Carlos was there. He traded the protein bar for a couple of cigs. Dan ate the bar and in a few minutes his whole face swelled up, Dan dropped to his knees and started gasping. 
1347 = Call out for help
1348 = I shouted: "Someone! Help! He can't breath!" When everyone rushed out of the gym, I cut off the netsuke with the scissors. 
1349 = Cut off the netsuke
1350 = While Dan was writhing in pain, I took the scissors and cut off the netsuke from his neck.
1351 = I got the figurine from Dan and then shouted to Carlos to get out. Instead, the Mexican knelt over Dan's body. He was holding his hands over his mouth and nose. "What the hell are you doing?" - "I have a bone to pick with this freak. Get lost!"
1352 = Try to stop Carlos
1353 = I rushed over to Carlos, but a moment later he was holding a shiv in his right hand. "Better not stand in my way, mi compañero." Carlos was bigger and stronger than me, and holding a weapon.
1354 = That wasn't the deal!
1355 = "I've done my part. Now, get out!"
1356 = You used me!
1357 = "Mi compañero, if you still haven't understood, using others is the only way to survive in East Castle."
1358 = Don't kill him!
1359 = "And this is not your business, mi compañero"
1360 = I gave up and walked out of the room and closed the door. I knew that in a few moments Dan would be dead and his death would be on me. I will remember this day for the rest of my life. The day when Eddie Boyd became a murderer. 
1361 = Steal the rat figurine
1362 = It's time to get real now and get the last figurine that I need. I must [green]make a play[/green] and play some cards in our mini Las Vegas. That should be the easiest way to get it. Folks say that it ain't a place for suckers and the minimum bet for a game is 350 cigarettes.
1363 = There's a rumor that Scrawny is a greedy fuck. He once lost all of his stuff to a fella because he just couldn't stop. Lucky me. I doubt that he'll pass on a big game if I bet, say, 350 cigarettes.
1364 = Knock at Scrawny's door
1365 = Leave it till later
1366 = I thought that I wasn't ready to compete with that ghoul, and decided to return to my cell.
1367 = I knocked on the door and a few seconds later a freaking giant opened it. He stared at me and then yelled: "What the fuck you want, huh?"
1368 = Show him the cigs
1369 = Huh?
1370 = This freaking giant went toward me and tried to reach me with his gorilla-like arms but I managed to step aside and quickly pulled out my stash of cigs. Seems these guys aren't very bright and and certainly don't have a sense of humor.
1371 = The big guy nodded and let me in. I took just a few steps before I was enveloped in a choking cloud of cigarette smoke. The smoke was so thick that I barely saw the large table in front of me. Scrawny was sitting next to it.
1372 = The rat netsuke was right there, on the table. I noticed a few tough looking thugs in the corner. You didn’t have to be a rocket scientist to understand that those guys would tear me apart if Scrawny tells them to. 
1373 = I wanna play big
1374 = At first, it seemed, that Scrawny thought he was dealing with some sort of a sucker he usually played against. When he heard about the high stakes on a big game, he perked up.\n"Your bet?" he asked.
1375 = By bid is 350 cigs!
1376 = "You're a brave fella, are you? Pity, that you'll soon be out of smokes, mate. I deal." Scrawny dealt the cards. We played a few rounds and I was lucky as ever. I won this one. I was just about to take my winnings when suddenly Scrawny put his skinny paw on them. "Not so fast, laddie. One more round"
1377 = Alright, but you bet the rat netsuke
1378 = "Ah, that's why you came here, slyboots", Scrawny stared at me for a while with his little gray eyes. "So be it. I bet my netsuke and you put up 700 cigarettes. Deal?"
1379 = No problem, bro.
1380 = I won the game! Damn it, I got so lucky! Scrawny picked up the glass bottle that was covering the rat netsuke. He was barely holding his anger. He handed me the rat netsuke and said: "Take it and scram". His goons didn't take their eyes off me. Gotta leg it.
1381 = I've lost everything! Lost 700 cigarettes. I must try to get the rat netsuke once again. Sarah's life depends on it!
1382 = While Fang, a senior in the kitchen, was talking shit with his buds, I looked in the notes to the prison menu and found out that Hulking Dan was on a diet because of some health problems.
1383 = To find out why Dan has earned a special ration, I need to [green] sign up for prison labor [/green] as a janitor at the infirmary. I have to look at his medical records when the guards aren’t watching me.
1384 = During my work I was snooping around the infirmary. There were two guards hanging around, and I need to get inside unnoticed. Not an easy task but not that a big deal for me . I saw Lil' Johnny and Brainy Larry at the end of the corridor. Perhaps they can help me.
1385 = Bribe the inmates
1386 = I gave a pack of cigarettes to each one of them and they set up a play to distract the guards. Without wasting any time I went inside the infiramry and searched for Hulking Dan's medical records. It was pretty easy to find them and I learned that he was allergic to nuts!
1387 = Risk it on my own
1388 = I managed to sneak past the guards and searched for Hulking Dan's medical records. I found them and learned that he was allergic to nuts.
1389 = It turned out the guards were quick-eyed devils. One of them bent my hand when I was looking for Dan's medical records, and the other one punched me in the face. I have to try again later. At least after my nose stops bleedin'.
1390 = "Your choices are few, bro. Either you trust me and do as I say or I'll send you Sarah's head in a box."
1391 = "The only guarantee is my word. Either you agree, or I'll send you Sarah's head in a box."
1392 = Why are you telling me this?
1393 = What's your interest?
1394 = But Carlos did not answer and disappeared in the dark corridor. What if I do what Carlos said, but instead of killing Dan, I will save him from the falling weight? Then Dan will be in my debt, and I'm gonna need friends like him.
1395 = One of the inmates got interested in one of my tattoos. He asked me what "Carpe Diem" means. While I was babbling on and on about how I had got it, someone snuck 5 cigarettes from my pocket. Damn, seems like someone actually seized the moment.
1396 = Lil' Johnny was built like a bull and believed to be mentally retarded, came to me and asked me for a couple of cigarettes. The moment I tried to tell him I was short of cigarettes that day, Johnny asked me to listen to a parable.
1397 = Listen to Lil' Johnny's parable
1398 = "There once was a hare, who did not believe that there were any hunters in the world. Only when the hare met one of them in the woods, he realized that they really existed. But it was too late." I waited for an ending or something but he just stared at me. 
1399 = The security chief called me and said that one of the inmates had vomited near the infirmary. "Go out there and make it shine like my cat's balls! You got me, Boyd?" He snapped out. Something went terribly wrong with my life... If I have to clean up some sucker's vomit...
1400 = Go to the infirmary
1401 = I picked up a mop, a bucket and a rag. I went to the infirmary and noticed some inmates were trying to walk around a puddle of vomit on the floor. If I at least had a pair of gloves, cleaning up all of this shit wouldn't be so disgusting.
1402 = Ask for gloves in the infirmary
1403 = I looked inside. There was a pretty nurse sitting in the room. I briefly described the situation. Apparently she didn't give a damn about me, but eventually she gave me a pair of gloves, so I'd get lost. Well at least it's something.
1404 = Ask the guard for gloves.
1405 = I went to talk to the bald guard, who was standing at the end of the corridor, and briefly described the situation. Apparently, he wanted that disgusting slime on the floor to vanish as soon as possible, so he quickly threw me a pair of rubber gloves. 
1406 = I put on my gloves. Well, now I'm ready for cleaning.
1407 = Start to clean the floor.
1408 = I began to scrub the floor with the mop. Finally I managed to finish it somehow. "Thought you could keep the gloves, huh?" the bald guard yelled at me. "Go wash them and bring them to the store room." The store room! I can get some pincers there!
1409 = Go to the store room
1410 = I did everything the bald guard told me to. The pincers were waiting for me in a dark corner, behind the mops. I was so glad that I almost guffawed loudly.
1411 = I managed to hide the pincers under my clothing and smuggle them past the guards. Whatever you say, sometimes you can find something good even in a pool of vomit.
1412 = "One of our employees hid the memory cards inside the netsuke and gave them to his friend in prison, to secure the data. The mob and law officials have a long reach, so all the information, including the investigation details, were destroyed. 
1413 = What will happen to us?
1414 = "You did an excellent job, Mr. Boyd. Our organization is not concerned with the police, so we will not hinder your escape." I took Sarah's hand. Finally, we are free. 
1415 = Share my plan with Sarah.
1416 = She laughed, and squeezed my hand even more. "Mr. Boyd" the boss man called me. I turned around. He and one of his men, the one whom he gave the memory cards to, looked at me. 
1417 = I don't know anything about it!
1418 = I'm not going back to prison!
1419 = He aimed his shotgun at me. "Don't make me repeat myself, Mr. Boyd. Come with us if you want to live."
1420 = Relax in my cell
1421 = I was lying on the bunk, for the hundredth time going through my plan. Is there anything I missed? Is everything ready for the escape? "Hey, compadre!" said Carlos from the upper bunk. A second later, I saw his face. He was holding an unfinished bottle of whiskey and handed it over to me.
1422 = Take the bottle
1423 = I took a sip and felt a pleasant warmth spreading over my body. Carlos jumped off the bunk and sat down opposite me.
1424 = I shook my head. Carlos smiled, finished the bottle, and then jumped off the upper bunk and sat down opposite me.
1425 = "You hate me, amigo?" Carlos asked quietly. \n "Yes", I told him. "But I hate myself even more ".\nCarlos nodded. "This place makes people violent. You don't fit in this place, Boyd. And you know it."
1426 = What do you mean?
1427 = What do you know?
1428 = "It was hard not to notice how you are sniffing around those figurines. I have no idea what you need them for. But I know they will get you in big trouble. Everyone knows it was you who stole all those figurines." 
1429 = Why should I trust you?
1430 = "Don't be stupid, Boyd. You can't trust anyone. But now you don't have any choice." Carlos gave me something wrapped in rags. I unwrapped the gift. There was a gun. 
1431 = Where did you get it?
1432 = What's that for?
1433 = Why are you helping me?
1434 = "What difference does it make? When someone gives you hope, you don't ask questions. You just say "thank you"."
1435 = Take the gun
1436 = "Thank you", I said and hid the gun in my robe. "I gotta go", Carlos said. He reached out and I shook his hand. I was totally confused. Why is Carlos helping me? Why did he kill Hulking Dan? Where did he get the gun? I will never find the answers to these questions.
1437 = To get the dragon figurine I'll need a distraction, a pair of scissors and a little bit of luck. The scissors are not a problem. I need to go to [green]sign up for prison labor[/green] in the library and I'll be able to steal the scissors from there. 
1438 = I finished digging the tunnel. I made sure everything was ready for the escape. I was really close to getting my freedom back. Now I have to get all three netsukes as soon as possible. 
1439 = My eyes were tearing up as I was lying on the floor for a long time. Diablo, Carlos!.. You’ve only been here for a couple of days and you’re already bored to death. How did you find yourself in this cesspool? 
1440 = Open your diary
1441 = This tatty book is able to tell all about me. It was in my teenage in El Paso when I started keeping it. I didn’t use to be a smuggler at that time. I was poor as a tramp. It was the time of my life, though.
1442 = Look at my tattoos
1443 = These tattoos can tell it all about me. The image of Virgin Mary was tattooed in El Paso, when I was a teenager. I didn’t use to be a smuggler at that time.  I was poor as a tramp. It was the time of my life, though.
1444 = Willy Novak, a skinny red-haired con with shifty eyes, entered my cell. That’s my neighbor. In El Paso that kind of guy was called “cadáver” – dead man. He wouldn’t last a single day here.  
1445 = Greet Novak
1446 = “Hola, amigo”, I said. Novak landed in the chair opposite me. His shifty eyes made it clear that he was eager to tell me something, but didn’t have the heart to do it. 
1447 = Keep quiet
1448 = I was silently staring at the window like there was no Novak around here. But he landed in the chair opposite me. His shifty eyes made it clear that he was eager to tell me something, but didn’t have the heart to do it.
1449 = “I need your help, buddy”, Novak said. "I heard you’re a smuggler. There’s gonna be a random shakedown in our cells. And I just got a plastic shiv. Will you help me out to stash it somewhere, so that these screws can’t find it?”
1450 = Why would I take a risk?
1451 = “I’ll give you 20 cigs, Carlos.” Oh, my! He called me by name. Seems like he desperately needs help. 
1452 = What’s in it for me?
1453 = “Oh, you won’t be left out, Carlos.”\nOh, my! He called me by name. Seems like he desperately needs help.\n“You'll get 20 cigs for it.” – said Novak.
1454 = Cigs are the jail currency. They’ll come in handy even if I don’t smoke. But ther's one more reason for helping this piece of trash. Willy Novak is a white-skinned con. And I desperately need white-skinned buddies here.
1455 = Deal. 
1456 = It was hard not to notice Navak's hands trembling. Why is he so spooked? “I’ve already got 4 warnings. If the screws find my shiv, they’ll send me to the SHU and to the D corpus afterwards. In no case should I get in there.” 
1457 = Look for a stash
1458 = There were times when I used to get 10 kilos of coke each time across the border. And now I’m searching for a stash for the plastic shiv. Life has tricked me in a cruel way.
1459 = Examine Willy's mattress
1460 = There were screams coming from the corridor. Looks like the guards are on the way. I've got at best one minute to find a place for the stash. 
1461 = Examine the bunk
1462 = An ordinary net bed. It'd be impossible even for a cocroach to hide here.
1463 = Examine the table and chair
1464 = I guess it's gonna be possible to make a stash under the chair with the help of a duct tape, some time later. But for the time being it's impossible to hide anything here.
1465 = Examine the toilet
1466 = Bingo. The stink is so unbearable, that the screws won't poke it for any price. The shiv can be tied with a thread to the pipe - that will give me aand Willy a good chance not to find ourselves in the SHU. "Hey, blanco!" I shouted. "Fetch me a thread, quickly!"
1467 = Tie the shiv to the pipe
1468 = Tie the shiv to the toilet
1469 = I neatly tied the shiv. In a couple of moments I heard heavy footsteps in the corridor.They're coming. I jumped up and was standing near my bunk just in a moment. "Cells' checking! Stand still!"
1470 = Carlos Lucke
1471 = A formidable guard appeared on the doorstep. His badge said "Turner". Diablo. I've already heard of this ghoul. I would never in a million years want to make him angry...
1472 = Avert my eyes
1473 = Look at Turner
1474 = Turner went slowly deep into the cell and stopped right opposite me. he was staring at me for some time. "Your surname, con!" he barked.
1475 = The mattress is thin and all steeped in holes. It's gonna be the first place they will get to frisk. Gotta find another place asap. If the screws catch me red-handed, I'll be the one to go into the SHU.
1476 = "Lucke!" said Turner. His eyes narrowed. It's not good. "Heard 'bout you. You are the one to flood our streets with the new drug."
1477 = Keep quiet
1478 = Give Turner an answer
1479 = "While there are dudes piping away, there will always be the ones, getting them drugs." Turner came up close to me. I felt the thick smell of his sweat. "We'll have talk later", he snarled angrily.
1480 = Well, Turner is definitely right. But I've been in that business for about twenty years and during that time I've learnt not to care about moral issues. I'm guided by the laws of supply and demand.
1481 = There were times, when Carlos used to be the best smuggler on either side of the border. Now he's serving his sentence in one the most Supermax prisons in the country. His task is to get inside the prison drug trade group and steal the recipe of a brand new drug. In this place, where betrayal and danger are waiting around every corner, it's only himself whom Carlos can count on.
1482 = Turner examined my bed. You're not gonna find anything here, cabron. Just as if he read my thoughts, Turner switched to the pillow. He gutted it, having torn off its edge. Novak flinched. Man, he's gonna have a meltdown!
1483 = Give Novak a signal
1484 = When Turner turned away, I gave Novak a signal to kick back. In that very moment Turner turned to me again. 
1485 = Do nothing
1486 = Suddenly Turner turned to me again.
1487 = "Have you got children, Lucke?" he asked me. I wasn't ready for the question. Yes, I've got a daughter. Camilla. She is my little angel, the one I'm living for. But why does this bald creep care about my family life? 
1488 = Yeah.
1489 = "Really? Then how would you feel if one day your kid took an overdose and dropped dead somewhere in the street?", Turner said.
1490 = No.
1491 = "Of course! If you had a child or a shred of conscience, you'd have thought of all those youngsters, who are piping away with omnicine and dropping dead right in the street!"
1492 = I got busted on my way to the west with a few kilos of new drug called omnicine. That deal should have been my last work for Angel. 
1493 = Very nice
1494 = Turner came up to the toilet and bent over to examine the lavatory lid. His face winced of a horrible smell, but his hand kept on sweeping behind the lavatory. That thug's gonna find my stash...
1495 = Distract his attention
1496 = I stepped forward. "Mister Turner! This place made me think of starting a new life. I'm going to become a new person." - "Officer Turner", he responded, looking at the tattoo on my arm. It said "Ley solo para los tontos" - "Law is for hicks".
1497 = Hope for being off the hook
1498 = "Fine, you dirtbags", said Turner and headed for the door. He didn't find anything. Novak wasn't able to believe his luck. "Lucke, you did it!", Novak was just about to hug me. 
1499 = Walk around the prison
1500 = While I was walking I remembered the day of my arrest. The thing that made me feel better was, that I had left enough money for my daughter to live a decent life. But soon all my plans went down the drain...
1501 = Archie burst out laughing. "It's the first time I came across such a polite Mexican. We'll definitely go halfsies. When you finish your munchies, come to the infirmary. We'll start cleaning the supply closet."
1502 = Angel found and taken over all my money stashes. So, if I want to get my dough back, I gotta start working again. According to Angel, omnicine is made in East Castle under control of the local white cons' group. 
1503 = Sit down on the bench
1504 = I sat down and was observing the cons for some time. Some were playing basketball, some were running, some were flapping their jaws. Cons are trying to keep themselves busy somehow, in order not to go nuts in this place.
1505 = Walk along the ground
1506 = I was strolling past the cons playing basketball. Some were swinging their arms, some were running, some were flapping their jaws. Cons are trying to keep themselves busy somehow, in order not to go nuts in this place. 
1507 = Everything's strict here: white cons keep to the white ones, black cons keep to the black ones. Latinos and Mexicans are two separate groupings. But how can I fit in the white cons' grouping? BANG! Suddenly my head was hit by a ball.  
1508 = Find the one who threw the ball
1509 = I jumped up to see who'd thrown the ball. That creep's gonna badly regret it. Carlos Lucke doesn't forgive such behavior towards him.
1510 = Do nothing
1511 = I continued sitting, keeping my head in my hands. Yeah, it sucks to get hit by the ball, but I don't want any trouble. Perhaps, I was hit accidentally.
1512 = "We'll have to throw away that ball. It touched the dirty Mex's head", someone cried out, and I recognized Novak's voice. All his buddies burst out laughing. I was out of my mind with anger. Without my help that creep would be ripping in SHU! 
1513 = Let it slide
1514 = I didn't let on that it struck me. In a few minutes the white cons got tired of insulting me.
1515 = Get into a shoving match
1516 = "You were not so brave in the cell this morning, you faggot!" I shouted. Novak quickly wiped the smile from his face. Some of white cons were about to head towards me, but there were some Mexicans hanging out nearby, and their ears perked up. 
1517 = Soon they dawdeled to the canteen. As they were walking I was watching them and thinking over my revenge plan for Willy Novak. "Lucke!" my thoughts were interrupted by Turner. 
1518 = Look for Archie, my new sidekick 
1519 = Today they are serving tacos in the canteen. "Tacos are the only thing worth living for, for most of the cons here", said a cheerful geezer behind me. They called him Old Jim. He's alredy been here in East Castle for forty years. 
1520 = Get my meal
1521 = I caught a few Mexican cons looking at me. They must be waiting for me to talk to them. But the moment I sit at the table with other Mexicans the door to the world of the white cons will be closed. "You Carlos Lucke?", a white con asked me.
1522 = That's me.
1523 = The con nodded with pleasure and landed opposite me. He looked like about thirty or something. Tall, stout, with dark eyes. There was curiosity in his eyes. And there was a tattoo of an angel on his shoulder.
1524 = And who are you?
1525 = The con smiled and landed oppisite me. He looked like about thirty or something. Tall, stout, with dark eyes. There was curiosity in his eyes. I noticed a tattoo of an angel on his shoulder.
1526 = Weird, but I didn't feel like breaking his nose, even though he'd called me "carbon". "I'm Archie Gentile. I'm gonna be your sidekick."
1527 = I hate guidos
1528 = Archie burst out laughing. "I was just hoping, that you wouldn't turn out to be a drag. When you finish packing away the food, come to the infirmary. We'll start cleaning the supply closet."
1529 = Make friends with Archie
1530 = Archie was waiting for me near the infirmary, whistling some stupid tune. "Man, Carlos, what's up with your face? "You look too grim for the East Castle." It was clear, Archie wanted to make friends.
1531 = Get down to work
1532 = Archie brought me to the dark basement room, where there used to be an archive a long time ago. Now the main treasure here was mold and rat shit. "Tu madre...", Were the only words I could say. Archie turned to me, offering me gloves and a respirator.  
1533 = Say "Thanks"
1534 = "Gracias, amigo." No way anyone will believe me if I say, that a white con helps a Mexican like that.
1535 = Keep quiet and take the gloves and respirator
1536 = I silently took what Archie'd offered. No way anyone will believe me if I say, that a white con helps a Mexican like that.
1537 = Archie and I got down to work. Our task was to clean out the walls from the mold and then insulate them with a special mortar. After half an hour, all this work almost made me scream, but Archie was as cool as a cucumber. 
1538 = Keep quiet and work
1539 = Tell Archie an anecdote
1540 = "A death row inmate escaped from the prison. The chief sent out the photos of the fugitive: full-face, right profile, left profile. The following day there came a message from the neighboring town: "All three criminals were killed during detention."
1541 = ""
1542 = Archie was nickering for a long time and then called that anecdote the funniest he had ever heard.
1543 = Archie pretended that the anectode was funny for him, but it was so lame. An awkward pause followed it. 
1544 = Make a break
1545 = Two hours later Archie got a bottle of whiskey out of the stash in the floor. "I've been keeping this babe for spaecial occasion", he said.
1546 = Drink the whiskey
1547 = "Thanks, amigo. A Mexican will never refuse a good bottle of booze.
1548 = Refuse
1549 = "I'm out, amigo. Prefer keeping my mind clear."
1550 = Archie and I were sitting on the floor in a stinky damp room. But for the first time here I felt fine. "Perhaps East Castle isn't as terrible of a place, as I'd thought", I said to Archie. "You know nothing, Carlos Lucke", he answered.
1551 = What do you mean?
1552 = Are you in danger?
1553 = With no reply, Archie stood up and opened the door to another room. "This place has even more mold", he said. "We'll start cleaning it in the afternoon." I leaned against the wall and closed my eyes for a moment...
1554 = Wake up
1555 = ...and opened them only after an hour or so. It took me some time to recall where I was. "Gentile?" I cried out. No answer. I got back on my feet. How long have I been sleeping? I gotta find Archie asap.
1556 = Search the corridor
1557 = I opened the door and looked out in the corridor. Just a few screws. Gotta keep on seaching.
1558 = Search the neighboring room.
1559 = I opened the door to the neighboring supply closet. "Let...let me go..." came from the far corner. I looked in that direction. Archie was sitting on the floor. His head was down on his chest.
1560 = Go to Archie
1561 = I ran up to Archie. He was unconscious. What happened to him?
1562 = Ransack the room
1563 = I took a look around. There was a pack of drugs lying next to him. I took it. "Omnicine". Gentile is high! But where did he manage to get the drug from. Archie must be somehow connected with the prison mob. 
1564 = Interrogate Archie
1565 = I grabbed Gentile by the neck and started shaking him. "Carlos, my friend", Archie mumbled. "Thanks for helping me. I was just looking for a sidekick, that wouldn't rat me out. If any of them finds out that I took the dope, I'm screwed."
1566 = Who are "they"?
1567 = Do you work for the prison mob?
1568 = "They call themselves Family", he said in a low voice. I remembered Angel telling me something about the secret lab, which was producing omnicine. "Where's the lab?" I asked. "Only the chosen ones may enter it", Archie said.
1569 = Help Archie
1570 = I somehow helped Gentile get to his crib and tucked him into his bunk. "Hey, Carlos!" called Archie. "If I talked bullshit, forget it. I was out of my mind." Archie smiled and turned to the wall. 
1571 = Ignore Archie
1572 = I made sure Archie was breathing and went to my crib. I lay down on the bunk. "If I talked bullshit, forget it", came from the corridor. It was Archie. "I was out of my mind." He smiled.
1573 = Looks like Archie's got serious problems with the dope. If he's really poaching dope from his dawgs to get high, he'll be caught sooner or later....and then he'll be busted. I need to get a dose to make Archie speak. 
1574 = "Cleaning? I'm gonna be a damn janitor?" Archie shrugged his shoulders. "That was chief of the security's order." I knew he would find a way to root against me.
1575 = Look for omnicine
1576 = If I keep my eyes and ears open, I'll be able to find out everything I need. In order to find out where in omnicine can be got in the prison, I need to talk with the cons and hang around the prison.
1577 = Having overheard the haggler's talk with some junkie, I learned that omnicine is impossible to be bought inside the prison. I guess that the prison mob won't dip their fingers in the their own bussines.
1578 = Production of this magnitude can't be kept secret for a long time. Chief of security, all the screws and the medical staff must be on the take and they are supposed not to let omnicine pass into the hands of local addicts. 
1579 = Headache is not enough reason to find myself in the infirmary. I can try self-poisoning though. The symptoms will be quite convincing, if I drink some vinegar. I just have to figure out how to get some vinegar.
1580 = Think of how to get the vinegar
1581 = I bet there'll be enough vinegar at the prison's kitchen. But how am I to get it? First I have to start working in the kitchen. It won't be that easy, 'cause it's one of the best places of work in the prison. 
1582 = Talk to Turner
1583 = I told Turner that I used to work in a roadhose when I was a teenager. Turner gave me a referral to the kitchen and warned me, that in case something went wrong he would twist me into a corckscrew with his own hands.
1584 = Turner told me to shove it. I gotta make contact with him. The screws let only the trustworthy people work in here. Probably, they're afraid that unreliable cons will steal oranges from the fridge.
1585 = Talk to Gato
1586 = There's one Mexican called Gato, who works in the kitchen. I guess, If I'm convincing enough, he help to get some vinegar. 
1587 = I waited for Gato after his shift in the canteen. Now I need to figure out how to convince him to help me. 
1588 = Promise a reward for Gato
1589 = I convinced Gato that I would be able to get a magazine with naked chicks. Gato, in his turn, promised to fetch me a bottle of vinegar. 
1590 = I tried to convince Gato that I would be able to find a magazine with naked chicks, if he managed to get me some vinegar, but it didn't go well.
1591 = Look for the vinegar in the kitchen
1592 = While Claw is busy showing the rest in the kitchen how to cook a bearable dinner out of the standard rice and beans, I have some time to take look around in the kitchen. 
1593 = Frisk the cupboards
1594 = Some of them are locked. Seems like the guard has the key. If I ask them to give me the key under the guise of getting some soda or black pepper, he'll hardly be able to reject.
1595 = Ask the guard to give the key
1596 = The guard gave me the key without questioning and said, that I could address him in case of any necessity. I'm lucky to have the screws on my side. Having opened the cupboard, I noticed a plastic bottle of vinegar. Bingo!
1597 = The guard checked me out and told me to shove it. Shit, if my rep among the screws was a bit better, this jigger would give the key without any questions! I gotta get along with these screws... 
1598 = Frisk the fridge
1599 = Fresh fruit and vegetables are stored here. One can fetch 5 cigs for an ordinary apple. I'll come back here some time later to take out some apples in my bosom. I noticed vinegar in one of the big carton boxes on a shelf. 
1600 = Take the box off the shelf
1601 = I stood on my tiptoes and took off the box from the shelf. Although the box was quite heavy, I managed to hold it and carefully put it on the floor. There was a reward waiting for me in the box: a full bottle of vinegar!
1602 = I maanaged to put the box down, but it was too heavy and rumbled down. Claw came quickly, having heard the noise. He at once was on to me that I had got into the fridge for a reason. He threw me out of the kitchen. 
1603 = Frisk the cupboard
1604 = There are real huge kitchen knives in the cupboard which is in the corner of the kitchen. Some time ago my uncle Jose slit the thoat of his wife's, my aunt Maria's, lover with a knife like that. And what's inside the cupboard?  
1605 = Ask Claw to give me the key
1606 = I came up th Claw and said that I wanted to take some cinnamon. Claw gave me the key, but told me not to be cheeky. I opened the cupboard and having noticed a bottle of vinegar, I took it. It is a success. 
1607 = I came up th Claw and said that I wanted to take some cinnamon for the pie out of the cupboard. Claw told me to shove it and added that only those cons, who proved their loyalty, can eat a pie. Shit!
1608 = Leave it till later
1609 = A few sips should be enough to cause some not too serious poisoning. If everyhting goes smoothly, it won't take much time to get into the infirmary and obtain omnicine.
1610 = Drink vinegar
1611 = I opened the bottle and took a few sips. Ugh! It's the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. I felt cramps in my stomach. Puta madre! I didn't expect the reaction to be so strong... I fell down on the floor.
1612 = Call for help
1613 = I was trying to call somebody, but there was only groaning coming out. 
1614 = Crawl towards the exit
1615 = I tried to crawl, but every move caused hellish pain in my stomach. 
1616 = I heard some voices. Somebody entered the kitchen. The last thing I remember before I passed out were Claw's words: "Damn, I knew that Mexican was a fuckin' druggy."
1617 = Bribe Gato
1618 = When I gave Gato the cigs, he promised to fetch some vinegar for me real soon. Some time after the meal he called me over and discreetly handed me a small vial. Muy bueno, we can start! 
1619 = I returned to my cell, opened up the vial and got ready to feel the disgusting taste of the vinagar. I took a small swallow... Nothing happened. There was water in the vial. Gato fooled me! I gotta find him and beat the crap out of him! 
1620 = Mess with Gato
1621 = I returned to the kitchen and called Gato over. "What the fuck, Gato! You palmed me off water instead of vinegar. You'll either make things right, or I'll be talking to you as it goes in El Paso!"
1622 = Gato tried to take the attention off the fact that he gave me water, and played dumb. But as soon as I twitched towards him, he stepped back and in a couple of minutes brought me another vial. 
1623 = Gato listened to me without the slightest interest, said that there was nothing he could do about it and that vinegar really tastes like water.
1624 = Let it slide
1625 = Fine, creep. I'll find another way to obtain what I need.
1626 = Beat the crap out of Gato
1627 = I hit Gato in the jaw, and when he fell down I added a few kicks to his liver. "Enough?" I asked. Gato started nodding and crawled towards the kitchen. In a few minutes he fetched me another vial. 
1628 = I was about to twitch towards him, but that creep turned out to be ready and managed to bounce off. The next moment he kicked me in the face. Then he serenely went to the kitchen. Shit! 
1629 = Check the vial
1630 = I immediately opened the vial and made sure there was vinegar inside.
1631 = Don't check the vial
1632 = I was sure that this time Gato wouldn't dare to fool me.
1633 = I decided to get a bit closer to the infirmary, so that I could get immediate help in case of an emergency. The door was slightly open. I opened the vial with vinegar.
1634 = I opened the bottle and took a few sips. Ugh! It's the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. I felt cramps in my stomach. Diablo! I didn't expect the reaction to be so strong... I fell down on the floor.
1635 = Call for help
1636 = I was trying to call somebody, but there was only groaning coming out. 
1637 = Crawl towards the infirmary
1638 = I tried to crawl, but every move caused a hellish pain in my stomach.
1639 = I heard some voices. Somebody entered the infirmary. The last thing I remember before I passed out were the pretty nurse's words: "Damn! Some stoned junkie again."
1640 = Take a look around the ward
1641 = That pretty nurse was sitting opposite me. "What was it? Attempted suicide?" she was looking at me the way all the pretty chicks look at complete losers.
1642 = "I can't read."
1643 = "I thought there was wine in the bottle. If I could read, I'd understand that the sticker said "Vinegar."
1644 = "I mixed up the bottles"
1645 = "I thought there was hooch in the bottle, and the "Vinegar" sticker was used as a distraction."
1646 = The girl started laughing. Bueno, she considers me a moron. That's exactly what I need. One can easily let his guard down in front of a moron. If omnicine is somewhere in the infirmary, I'm gonna find it.
1647 = Search the infirmary
1648 = Night fell and I was left alone in the infirmary. I carefully took the IV out of my arm and got out of bed. The medical staff room was behind the glass door in the same premises. I gotta open this door.
1649 = I entered the medical staff room. My eyes had already got used to the darkness here, so it didn't take much effort for me to open the safe near the window. I squatted in order to examine it.
1650 = Looks like the vinegar really knocked me down. I didn't have any strength to fiddle with that lock. 
1651 = Examine the safe
1652 = It was an ordinary safe, which could be found in a room of any hotel. Some time ago I used to be a naive dummy and thought that this thing guaranteed the safety of my stuff in a hotel. No such luck. 
1653 = I was lucky, because I had given fake ID's during my stay at the hotel, and the detectives didn't pick up the trail. As I got to know later, there is one standard combination for opening any safe like this. 
1654 = Enter the combination
1655 = I got hot flashes due to anxiety. I entered the code with a shaking hand: six zeros. The safe beeped and its display showed: OPENED. I pulled the safe's door and it opened. Thank you, thieving maid!  
1656 = Search the safe
1657 = I searched with my hand and found a few packs of omnicine among the medical documents. I took only one pack. It should be enough to blackmail Archie, and if I take too many Jenny can smell a rat. 
1658 = Return to my ward
1659 = Squeezing the pack of omnicine in my hand I snuck into my bed. Nobody heard me sneaking around. I was dreaming about Florida beaches, tons of dough, and hot chicks. Now I'm a little bit closer to them. 
1660 = Search the room
1661 = I decided to search the room quickly. It'd be frustrating if I missed something useful. I looked around. What else can I nick? 
1662 = Search the couch
1663 = I found a bottle of mineral water there. Great, it's gonna help me recuperate after the poisoning. I opened the bottle and took a few swallows. Good! 
1664 = Search the cupboard near the entrance
1665 = The door of the cupboard creacked as I opened it. There was a pack of protein bars on one of the shelves. I took a few. They will come in handy. 
1666 = I looked in all the corners, but couldn't find anything interesting there. Gotta get back to my ward. I discreetly slipped into my bed, covered myself with a warm blanket and fell asleep at once. I had a nightmare, where I was running away from some villains and they were shooting into my chest. 
1667 = Jenny soon ordered me to go back to my cell. I managed to hide omnicine in the stash, in the floor under the bunk. While I was busy with the stash, I was thinking of how to keep my mind occupied until a suitable moment for the talk with Archie comes. 
1668 = I hardly managed to put omnicine in the stash when nurse Jenny came in together with Turner. They got me to roll because of the broken door lock in the medical staff room and I ended up in SHU. That sucked, but I used the time to think about my future. 
1669 = Think my actions over
1670 = The only way to get inside "the family" is to become useful for at least one of its members. I gotta become the prison haggler. My cousin Gregory can help me in that. Some time ago I saved Gregory's ass by paying his debt to the local thugs. It's high time to remind my cousin about the importance of kinship.
1671 = Call Gregory
1672 = I need to get a phone card so that I can call Gregory. There is a dude making a call on a telephone right now. I can buy a phone card from him or simply make a fight and take the card away. 
1673 = Buy a phone card
1674 = Take it away from another con
1675 = I waylaid some vic near the phone booth. As soon as he took out the phone card and was going to call his mum, I grabbed the card out of his hand. "I'm gonna keep it, amigo!" I said. 
1676 = The con came at me, but I took him single-handedly. We had been punching each other for some time in the corridor until he realized that he couldn't cope with me. He flipped me off and got away. Bueno. Now I can call Gregory. 
1677 = The con didn't like that at all and he came at me. He managed to hit me in the face. Eventually I threw his phone card at him and got away. That con still kept on running after me and cursing for a long time. People tend to be so on edge here!
1678 = Call my cousin
1679 = "Si.." I heard on the other end of the line. Gregory always pretends like he doesn't speak English. It's very useful when you need to freeze somebody out and hang up. "Hey, dirtbag", I said in English. "Carlos, primo! Goddammit, where have you been..." 
1680 = Ask for help
1681 = I said: "There's a way to gain authority here in prison. I need you to regularly throw over the fence some little knick-knacks. It won't take much effort, and my life here will be better..."Gregory interrupted me: "No, it's too dangerous." 
1682 = Put pressure on him
1683 = "Those, who act like this with their families, come to a bad end, Gregory. D'you remember, that I was risking my ass while helping you with your gambling debt?"
1684 = Remind about the debt
1685 = "You don't do that to your family, Gregory. D'you remember, that I was risking my ass while helping you with your gambling debt?"
1686 = Start threatening
1687 = "Those, who act like this with their families, come to a bad end, Gregory. D'you remember, that I was risking my ass while helping you with your gambling debt?"
1688 = Blackmail
1689 = "Listen, cousin", I said. "You remember my boss Angel? He's been looking closely at this turf for quite a long time. I was the only reason he stopped. You'll have to work for me so that your turf remains your turf, and you can keep on pushing your hash. 
1690 = Gregory said: " Fine. Tell me how and what to deliver to you." Bueno. Gregory's on it. We can get our small prison business started. All we gotta do is wait for the first parcel.
1691 = Take the parcel from Gregory
1692 = In a few days, walking along the fence, I found a small parcel from Gregory. I picked it up and headed for my crib. Willy Novak was there, so I had to wait until he left. He turned around right at the doorway and said: "Hey, Lucke! Sorry for calling you 'dirty Mexican'!"
" 
1693 = No problem!
1694 = "Hey, I get it, amigo! We can be dudes while we are here in the cell, but our geezers shouldn't know 'bout it. It's the law of the jungle. Elephants keep to the elephants, lions keep to the lions." Such words from me were unexpected for Novak. Finally that cabron got away. 
1695 = Fuck you!
1696 = "Hey, carbon, grow a pair! If you call me a dirty Mexican in front of your buddies, mean what you say and be ready to repeat it in my face. And now shove it! Don't wanna see your mug." Novak didn't dare to say anything. 
1697 = Finally I got rid of that barstard. I'd gladly gather all the morons like Novak on a desert island and throw a bomb, with a Mexican flag painted on it.
1698 = Open up the parcel
1699 = Perfect, everything I ordered is here. Soon I'll spread a rumour that I can get various goods for a small fee. Carlos Lucke is back in business! I laid my eyes on Novak's bunk. If I want to make them respect me, I gotta get even with Novak for insulting me. 
1700 = Take revenge against Novak
1701 = I made sure there was nobody around and got down to business. Everything was ready in a couple of minutes. Now all that is left to do is to wait for the scheduled inspection.
1702 = Wait for the inspection
1703 = In the evening, when the screws patted down the cells, Novak and I were standing opposite each other. Willy was trying not to look me in the eyes. Maggot! Turner and another screw entered the cell.
1704 = Stand still and keep silent!
1705 = Greet Turner
1706 = "Good evening, sir!" I said loudly. I'm in a great mood today.
1707 = They checked my stuff but didn't find anything. Novak was less lucky. They found some marijuana, a shiv, a bottle of whiskey and much more interesting stuff under his mattress. I couldn't help smiling when he was being dragged to SHU. Apart from the series "The Sopranos", revenge is my favourite thing. 
1708 = Bail on the grudge
1709 = Fine, fuck you, wanker! Sometimes my own kindness surprises me.
1710 = Let everyone know about my new business
1711 = Now I need to hang out around the prison and talk with the cons as much as possible, so that everybody was aware that Carlos Lucke is the new prison haggler. It's my time to shine as a smuggler!
1712 = It took me a couple of days to get my first dozen orders. I developed an efficient scheme of getting parcels from the outside. Of course, my cousin Gregory wasn't a genius, but he did as I'd told him to, so the parcels got right into my hands. Soon I got a prison nickname, 'Stashes'. 
1713 = Look at the list of orders
1714 = Ok, what do we have here today...One con asked for a lighter, another one wanted some dope, the third one asked for steroids for the workout room. Now, since I have what they want, I can use the cons to my advantage. I need to follow Archie to sort out the details of the prison drug dealings. 
1715 = Follow Archie
1716 = I managed to bribe several cholos with the help of canned food, cigs and some instant noodles. They agreed to become my spies.
1717 = Find out what'd my spies uncover
1718 = Having got a few extra pairs of eyes and ears, I got to know that Archie had visited nurse Jenny four times in the infirmary during the previous 24 hours. Looks like Archie's suffering from withdrawal. I gotta visit him and try to exchange some info for a dose. 
1719 = Interrogate Archie
1720 = I stopped at the doorstep of his cell. Archie was lying on the bunk with his face tucked in the pillow. There were a few posters with hot white and black chicks on the wall. "What the hell d'you want, Lucke?" asked Gentile.
1721 = "I heard you were in trouble"
1722 = "That's none of your business!" This very moment I realized that there was nobody in this dump whom I'd treat better than Gentile. Seems like I considered him to be my friend, in my heart of hearts. I'm so damn pathetic.
1723 = "I want to continue our talk."
1724 = "Really? I don't." for a moment I felt that Archie was my only friend in that dump. That thought seemed freakin' sad. Taking into account that I was gonna use Archie to my advantage...
1725 = Archie turned to the window, signalling that our conversation was over. I looked around and made sure there was nobody around.
1726 = Show Archie the drug
1727 = "I've got something for you, blanco",  I said, sitting down on the chair opposite Gentile. In a moment I pulled out a packet with dope.
1728 = Archie's eyes lit up, and his hands reached out for the dope. "Diablo, Gentile! You're a strung-out junkie" I hid the package back in my bosom. I understood that after this Archie would do everything I'd tell him to. "What d'you want?" he asked.
1729 = Archie shrugged his shoulders. He doesn't look like he's ready for a friendly talk. So I have to ask in another way. 
1730 = Beat the crap out of Archie
1731 = I grabbed Archie's shoulders and threw him against the wall as hard as I could. 
1732 = He wasn't even trying to protect himself. "I'm not even gonna coax you, Gentile. You'll either answer my questions and get a dose as a reward, or I'll smash your head in immediately." After a second thought Archie asked: "What d'you want?" 
1733 = There were tears swelling up in his eyes. "I'm already a deadman, Lucke", Said Archie. "And yet what a difference a day makes. You can put me down right now."
1734 = Calm Gentile down
1735 = "Stop moaning, creep. If you help me, I'll help you." Archie wiped his tears away and said wearily: "Fine, the hell with you. What d'you need?"  
1736 = One more hit
1737 = I smashed Archie against the wall once again. "Enough?" I asked, and punched him to the gut just in case. Archie doubled over. "Fine", he mumbled. "What the hell d'you want?" 
1738 = Ask about the drug trade
1739 = Ask about the boss
1740 = Archie shook his head. You don't know what you're getting into." But I was firm about it.\n"I wanna know everything", I said.
1741 = Listen to Archie's story
1742 = "Boss's name is John Holland. He's been sitting here for ten years already. His business outside was the same as here: running the drug empire. Since he was arrested nothing's changed. He runs them all: the screws, the security chief... It's his prison, Lucke. And we are his property." 
1743 = Archie stretched his hand out for the dose. "No, Gentile, we are not done yet", I said. "You'll tell me everything that I want."
1744 = How did you end up in the band?
1745 = "My father was Holland's partner. It was Holland who helped me get in here after I'd been convicted of money-laundering. I felt I was safe here as he took me under his wing...Damn, how wrong I was."
1746 = Who else does the family consist of?
1747 = "Everyone that Holland wants. Nobody here rejects Holland if he has a task for you. But the core of his band consists of fifteen people. Almost all of them are white. Each has his own job. Someone makes omnicine in the lab, someone handles issues with cons, someone serves as a bodyguard..." 
1748 = Tell me about Holland
1749 = He's the smartest person I've ever met. He's always many steps ahead. It's like chess, but he's got people instead of pawns. He sacrifices them without the slightest regret. This man is a real devil." There was something Archie wanted to add, but he shut up. 
1750 = Where's the lab?
1751 = "Under the laundry room. You can't get in there without the code for the lock. They say, it's a state-of-the-art lab... After Holland invented omnicine, its recipe was kept a dark secret. 
1752 = Where's the recipe kept?
1753 = "I heard, the recipe is kept somewhere in the lab. But I've never been there. Holland's never trusted me completely. I'm sort of an errand boy for him."
1754 = How can I get into the family?
1755 = "But Lucke, you don't seem to be listening to me. Nobody of sound mind would wanna become part of the family. It seems that you'll be secure and in power... But that's not true. Only one person has the power there. And he'll throw you away as soon as you become useless for him." 
1756 = You are to introduce me to Holland
1757 = Archie jumped off the bunk and came up to the window. "Go away", he said. "This talk never existed." Well, I heard quite enough for me. I stood up and was about to leave. "Lucke?" called Archie. He was waiting for his dose.
1758 = Give omnicine to Archie
1759 = Diablo, I nearly forgot! I took a packet from my bosom and put it under Archie's mattress. "Sweet dreams", I said on my way to the corridor.
1760 = Keep omnicine for myself
1761 = "I'll keep this shit for myself", I said. "It's not because of my greed, I feel sorry for you, Gentile. You gotta give up piping way. Sweet dreams." Having said that, I left the cell.  
1762 = Go to the cell
1763 = Go to the prison yard
1764 = Having made a few steps along the corridor, I saw that very con, whom I had sold steroids for the workout room. He noticed me and smiled. "Hi, Carlos", he said. "I was just looking for you. Will you round me up some more steroids? Those from last time were unparalleled!"
1765 = Yeah, sure.
1766 = "Thanks, man. I'll be waiting. By the way, I'm Dan. They call me Hulking Dan."
1767 = There's nothing I can do
1768 = "Fine. Maybe another time. By the way, I'm Dan. They call me Hulking Dan."
1769 = "My pleasure", I grumbled. This Dan is being too nice to me. I suspect some trick. I turned around and saw Archie standing behind us. He was as pale as death. He was keeping his eye on Hulking Dan. Something smells fishy.
1770 = Talk to Hulking Dan
1771 = I need to think of how to curry favour with John Holland. Perhaps, Hulking Dan can help me in it. I can find Dan if I [green]go jogging[/green], [green]go to the playground[/green], [green]work out at the gym[/green] or [green]rest[/green] in the common room. 
1772 = I went to the workout room to take a closer look at Hulking Dan. When I came into the gym Dan was working out with some hicks. He smiled at me: "Hi, Lucke! Got anythin'?" What's he talking about? Oh, right, he was asking me about the steroids last time...
1773 = Nope
1774 = Not yet
1775 = "Then why did you show up here?" asked Dan. "Wanna bulk up. Life is always easier for muscly guys", I responded. Having looked at me from head to toe Dan said: "When one knows what's what he'll find a way to solve his problems with the help of someone else's muscles."
1776 = Dan started showing me around the workout equipment, talking about them as if they were his buddies. When our excursion was over, Dan turned to me and said: "So, what d'you want?"
1777 = Next day I went to the court to take a closer look at Hulking Dan. I came to the court, Dan had already been playing basketball with the other cons. He smiled at me: "Hey, Lucke! Got anythin'?"
1778 = "Then why did you show up here?" asked Dan. "Wanna play. Life is always easier for a good player." Dan burst out laughing. Having looked at me from head to toe he said: "Sometimes games might be dangerous. Fine. Let me show you what's what."
1779 = Dan introduced me to his dudes. Everyone was treating me politely, even too much. Then we sat on the bench, he turned to me and said: "So, fire away. What the hell d'you want?"  
1780 = Next day I went to the common room to take a closer look at Hulking Dan. When I came in, Dan was already there, watching "Game of Thrones". He told me: "Lucke, got anythin'?" 
1781 = "Then why did you show up here?" asked Dan. "All the cons are lollygagging about some dragons." Having looked at me from head to toe Dan said: "Dragons are bullshit. Another thing is with white walkers. Let me show you what's what." 
1782 = Dan started telling me about the hot blanca chick, who murdered all the dudes; then something about a snowy bastard who knew nothing. When the commercial break finally started, Den turned to me and said: "So, fire away. What the hell d'you want?" 
1783 = Well, I came without any reason
1784 = "Whom are you trying to fuck over, Mexican? I saw you with Archie. That creep must have told you some bullshit about the drug trade. 
1785 = I wanna become a member of the Family
1786 = I don't know what that bastard's told you, but you should know that he is a junkie. Such jerks can't be trusted." 
1787 = I said: "I know that you need trustworthy people. I'm exactly that kind." Dan was keeping quiet. I couldn't figure out what was on his mind. "OK, Mexican. Suppose, we have some work for you. How do we know that you can be trusted?" 
1788 = I'm ready to prove my loyalty
1789 = "Fine. Come to the laundry room in the afternoon." I nodded and went back to my cell. I hope all this shit worth one and a half million bucks, which we had agreed on with Angel before. 
1790 = Get acquainted with Holland
1791 = After lunch I went straight to the laundry room. It wasn't very crowded: there was an old one-legged con, some youngster and a spooky-looking stiff. Everyone was busy neatly putting the clean sheets in piles. Whom should I talk to?
1792 = To the old one
1793 = I came up to the one-legged con and greeted him. "What d'you want, Mexican?" he answered. "We are not taking the cons' duds today."\n"I know, I know", I replied. "I'd like to have a word with Hulking Dan."
1794 = To a youngster
1795 = I came up to the young con and greeted him. Seems like he's ordered a magazine with chicks recently... The kid tuned out and said that they weren't taking the cons' duds that day. "I know, I know", I replied. "I'd like to have a word with Hulking Dan."
1796 = To a stiff
1797 = I came up to the stiff and greeted him. Seems like I've already seen him in the workout room with Dan. The stiff looked me up and down and said that they weren't taking the cons' duds that day. "I know, I know", I replied. "I'd like to have a word with Hulking Dan."
1798 = All the three cons stared at me as if I were a public enemy. The stiff turned to me and hissed: "Dan doesn't work in the laundry room. Get outta here while you're still in one piece."
1799 = Stand your ground
1800 = Dan told me to come here in the afternoon. If he's not here, I'll stay and wait.
1801 = Walk away obediently
1802 = I decided not to keep pushing and got out of the laundry room. These cons here are so damn nervous.
1803 = Calm the stiff down
1804 = "Easy, pal! Dan just told me to come here in the afternoon. If he's out at the moment, I'll come later and wait for him..."
1805 = Looks like the stiff took it well. "No, you're not gonna stay here, you fuckin' immigrant", he said moving towards me. "Get outta here while you're still in one piece!" The stiff swung at me, but suddenly there came a whistle.
1806 = Look back
1807 = There was a white middle-aged dude five feet away from us. He was calm and fearless. Even before he opened his mouth I had already got whom I was dealing with. "Friendliness is not Aaron's strong point. There are almost no strangers around here, though.", he said.
1808 = Are you Holland? 
1809 = "Yes, my friend", he replied Holland laughing. "Welcome."
1810 = I'm not a stranger
1811 = "I know, Carlos", replied Holland, laughing. "Otherwise Dan wouldn't have invited you here."
1812 = My name's Carlos
1813 = "I'm glad Dan invited you here, Carlos", said Holland. "Welcome."
1814 = "Follow me", he added. Stiff Aaron kept on looking at me for a long time. Holland brought me to some closet, its entrance was in the dark corner of the laundry room. "Make yourself comfortable", said Holland. I sat down on the chair. "What do you want, Carlos?", asked Holland. 
1815 = Protection
1816 = Money
1817 = Power
1818 = "It's a lot Carlos! There will also be a lot that you'll have to give back for it. I'll give you a chance to prove that you're worth becoming a part of our family. Dan will fill you in on the details." Holland started looking through some papers, showing our conversation was over. 
1819 = Leave the closet
1820 = I stood up and went towards the entrance. Dan had already been waiting for me there. As he noticed me ha said: "Well, Lucke, are you ready for the first task? I promise it's gonna be a gravy train."
1821 = Go on a mission with Dan
1822 = "Ready, mi compañero." Dan took me to the infirmary the long way round.
1823 = Return to the cell
1824 = "No, compañero, I've got a stomach ache. Gotta rest it off in my cell.
1825 = Our talk echoed in the corridor. Fluorescent lamps were crazily twinkling above our heads.
1826 = Perform the first task.
1827 = "What's the task?" I asked. "Nothing special." Then we kept on walking silently until we reached the infirmary. Dan entered the infirmary, and when I was about to follow him, he stopped me. "Stay here. If the guard comes, prevent him from entering!" Dan entered the infirmary.
1828 = Stay in the corridor
1829 = Enter the infirmary
1830 = I pulled the doorknob, but it didn't work. Dan must have locked the door from the inside.
1831 = I took a look around. The sound of footsteps came from the other side of the corridor. It's a guard! Oh, shit! What am I to do?
1832 = Distract
1833 = If I distract him, Dan will be able to finish his work in the infirmary. I made a few steps to the left and found myself in the darkest part of the corridor. "Hey, screw! Kiss my ass!" I shouted. The guard startled and stopped. I gotta shove off!
1834 = Run to the left
1835 = Run to the right
1836 = I took off running. The guard ran after me. "Code 310! The inmate is moving towards the western wing of the prison!" he shouted on the radio. Diablo! I gotta lay low, otherwise I will be caught.  
1837 = Keep on running
1838 = I ran several meters more and lay down behind the corner. The guard ran to the gym entrance and stopped. He probably decided that I'd hidden myself in the workout room, so he went there. Meanwhile, I returned to the infirmary.  Dan went out of there. 
1839 = Hide myself in the workout room
1840 = I ran into the gym and lay down in the changing room. The guard kept on running along the corridor. I waited for a couple of minutes more, went out of the gym and returned to the infirmary without any fuss. At that very moment Dan got out of there.
1841 = Talk his ears off
1842 = I stepped in front of the guard. It turned out to be Mendes, a ghoul with a moustache and long hands. "How are you doing, officer Mendes?" I said with an idiotic smile on my face. "What a lovely evening, isn't it?" He responded:  "What the hell d'you want, punk ass?" he said. 
1843 = Prison newspaper
1844 = There's been a lot of beefs between the cons and the wardens. I want to fix things between us, senior. I'm gonna release a prison newspaper for that. East Castle Times. What d'you think?" Mendes laughed: "East Castle Times? You can't even string a sentence together, idiot!" 
1845 = Showers
1846 = "Taking a shower has become a terrible thing lately, senior. It has always been so-so, but now it's total shit. There is mold is all over it. The drain is out of order, we've got to wash ourselves knee-deep in the water!' Mendes responded: "What's that got to do with me, idiot?" 
1847 = "I thought you'd be interested in the cons' problems..." I started. "No", the moustached cabron interrupted me. "I don't give a shit. Better tell me, have you seen nurse Jenny?"
1848 = The chief of security called her
1849 = She went to the entrance gate post
1850 = One of the cons felt sick
1851 = "Fine", said Mendes. "Don't let me catch you here anymore." The next moment he disappered around the corner at the end of the corridor. Puta madre! I was scared half to death! In that very moment I heard the door of the infirmary open. 
1852 = "Great!" said Dan and patted me on the shoulder. Now let's split up. You'll get your instructions for the second task tomorrow." It was the only thing Dan said, and I wasn't asking anything else.
1853 = I entered my crib and suddenly noticed some dude, lying on my bunk. My first thought was that it was Novak, although I was hoping that I'd got rid of him for good. But then I realized that my bunk was occupied by some new con.
1854 = My first thought was that Novak had been released from SHU, although I was hoping that I'd got rid of him for good. But then I realized that my bunk was occupied by some new con.
1855 = But it was some new con, not Novak. What happened while I was absent?
1856 = The con was facedown
1857 = Bring the con around
1858 = " I took my new neighbor by the shoulders and shook him up, but it didn't work."
1859 = Do nothing
1860 = As soon as I set down on my bunk the newcomer rolled onto his back and started calling some Sarah. I took a closer look. "Boyd, Edward", said his name tag. 
1861 = Lie down on the bunk
1862 = I lay on my back. "Sarah..." came from below. Man, broads cause only problems, if you haven't got it yet. I bet this Boyd ended up in prison because of this Sarah. Anyway, everyone has his own story here. Someday my own one will seem like a nightmare to me. 
1863 = What's the head of The Family name?
1864 = How to become a member of The Family"?
1865 = But I didn't manage to get any comprehensible answer from Gentile. So I had to complete everything myself, and I was dog-tired. We had to return to our cells for the evening roll call, and I still couldn't understand what to do with Archie.
1866 = Go to my cell
1867 = Find out what the second task is
1868 = I woke up in a perfect mood. My new cellmate recovered as well. At first he was a rather lost-looking thing, as if he couldn't figure out where he actually was.Then he asked me where he was. Diablo, he really has no idea. It's hilarious!
1869 = Congrats, bro
1870 = "You got into East Castle, the most secure supermax prison in the country. And I'm Carlos, your bunkie." Boyd was slightly bummed because of that news. "How long have I been here?" Boyd asked. What's wrong with that dude? Has he really lost his memory?  
1871 = They brought you in last night.
1872 = "You've been unconscious all this time and calling out to some Sarah." As soon as my new mate heard about Sarah, he dropped his head. Boyd was walking back and forth. Somehow, I need to distract this lame duck. 
1873 = They call me "Stashes" 
1874 = "Obviously it's because I know how to get contraband in and hide it. That's what I did on the outside and that's what I continue doing inside." Boyd introduced himself, we shook hands, and I noticed that there was blood on his sleeve. 
1875 = Go to Dan
1876 = I didn't find Dan in the cell and decided to have a walk along the corridor. I wanted to ask the dudes whether they'd seen Hulking Dan. Passing by Archie's cell I noticed some weird fuss there.
1877 = Look inside Archie's cell
1878 = I came closer and looked inside to figure out what was happening. Archie's cell mate was packing his stuff in a sack. Officer Mendes and nurse Jenny were standing there as well. 
1879 = Stay in the corridor
1880 = I stayed in the corridor for some time. I could be see from here how Archie's cell mate was packing his stuff in a sack. Officer Mendes and nurse Jenny were standing there as well. 
1881 = There were some dudes standing not far. One of them was Stan Paulson, a white con, whom I'd pushed some goods for a couple of times. I came up to him and asked, what the hell was going on there. "Gentile is dead", said Stan, and something inside of me died. Diablo.  
1882 = How did it happen?
1883 = "He got an overdose of a new drug. Weird, where he could get it. Got into the infirmary and kicked off there." Omnicine. It was me, who gave Archie the drug! He died because of me! But...
1884 = "He was doing a new drug, omnicine. The moment came when he couldn't get a new dose. Then Gentile took the blade out of a safety razor and cut his wrists. Got into the infirmary and died."  Archie died because I hadn't given him the drug. It's all my fault! But...
1885 = You said he had died in the infirmary?
1886 = "Yeah. At least he was still alive when he got there", Stan answered. "When did it happen?" I asked. "Yesterday, at about eight p.m." After I heard that, everything went dark. That's right. Archie was murdered. And it was Hulking Dan and me who murdered him.
1887 = Go to the workout room
1888 = I needed some time to be alone. I went to the gym, hoping that no one would be there at that time. So it was the case. I closed the door tightly and was staring at the floor for a couple of moments. And then I was hammering on the wall as hard as I could. 
1889 = Go to the chapel
1890 = I needed some time to be alone. I went to the chapel, hoping that there wouldn't be anyone at that time. So it was the case. I closed the door tightly and started hammering on the wall as hard as I could.
1891 = I was used. Archie was right: these guys are beasts. I gotta finish what I've started, and then I'll find a way to get back at Dan and Holland. I have to be careful, and get on my game. I need to find Dan. All the cons are chowing now, I should also go to the canteen. 
1892 = Find Dan and get instructions
1893 = All the cons are chowing now. If I want to find Dan I need to go to the canteen.
1894 = Todnight is the taco night. I met Archie on a night like this. While I was waiting for my food, I watched other cons. They were really happy about normal food, some of them were laughing, someone was telling stories. Archie's death hasn't changed anything.
1895 = Find Holland and Dan
1896 = I took a look around. Holland, Dan, Aaron and a few more cons were sitting at the back booth. They were chowing down and discussing something, as if nothing had happened. I got my meal. Which table to choose? 
1897 = Join Holland's table
1898 = I came up to Holland's table. Everyone sitting there loooked at me. A moment later a place for me appeared. "Everybody, that's Carlos. Carlos, that's everybody", said Holland. "Carlos helped us in one very important case. So, from now on he's on our team.
1899 = What's the next task?
1900 = "That guy doesn't waste time!" Holland laughed. "See those gentlemen?" he nodded towards the table, occupied by the gang of Mexicans. "They've caused too much trouble lately. We need to explain to our Mexican guests, that we have different laws on this side of the border." 
1901 = I'm on it.
1902 = "You can count on me", I said. "Man, I love this guy!" said Holland smiling. "Listen attentively. The fight's gonna be in a couple of days. You should find some suitable weapon. You'll have to fight against several adversaries. The better you get ready, the fewer surprises you'll have."
1903 = I'm out
1904 = "I'm not ready to risk my ass against the Mexicans yet", I said. "Then come back when you are ready", said Holland coldly.
1905 = Sit at the separate table
1906 = I found a quiet spot for myself in the corner of the canteen. Everyone could be seen from there. In a few moments Dan stood up and headed towards my table. "Hey, Carlos!" he said with his vile smile. "There are some guys wanting to meet you. Would you like to join us?"
1907 = Yes
1908 = I stood up and followed Dan to Holland's table. Everyone sitting there loooked at me. In a moment a place for me appeared. "Everybody, that's Carlos. Carlos, that's everybody", said Holland. "Carlos helped us in one important case. Now he's one of us."
1909 = ""
1910 = No.
1911 = "I'd better stay here, amigo", I said. "Fine", answered Dan. "Can you see those Mexicans over there?" he nodded towards the table, occupied by a gang of Mexicans. "We're gonna need you to hit them properly in the head. You'll have to fight against several adversaries."
1912 = "You can count on me", I said. "Bravo, Carlos! See you soon, then!" said Dan and returned to his table. My fists curled. Someday I'll get back at this smug bastard for Archie's death.
1913 = "I'm not ready to risk my ass against the Mexicans yet", I said. "Then come back when you are ready." said Dan coldly and returned to his table. My fists curled. Someday I'll get back at this smug bastard for Archie's death.
1914 = If I'm really gonna fight against the gang of Mexicans, I gotta start my trainig asap. If I'm already in deep shit, I need to find a way of getting out of there. 
1915 = Talk to Gregory
1916 = I need Gregory's help to get a weapon for the fight. This time the parcel from the outside won't contain any harmless junk, as it used to. I need a real weapon. I gotta try hard to persuade Gregory to help me. 
1917 = When I told my cousin what I needed from him, he didn't believe his ears at first,and even hung up on me. What a chickenshit! Finally, I managed to get through to Gregory and persuade him to send me a parcel with the weapon. 
1918 = Craft a weapon
1919 = It's very likely that the parcel with the weapon won't get into my hands before the fight begins. I gotta step it up and craft the weapon out of off-the-shelf items. Which weapon to choose?
1920 = A paper shiv
1921 = To make a paper shiv I'm gonna need three-four sheets of paper and scissors. Paper is free here. But it's not that easy when it comes to scisors. I need to go to work in the library to get them. 
1922 = A white con named Brainy Larry was reading Shakespeare aloud and drove everyone so mad, that another con named Sickly told him to shut up. Brainy flipped out and said, that he was surrounded by ignorant degenerates. The next moment Larry was on the floor.
1923 = Craft a paper shiv
1924 = Roll up one sheet of paper, cutting the edges. Put another paper tube inside this one, so that the shiv was more or less solid. A few sleight-of-hand moves, and my paper shiv is ready!
1925 = A shiv out of a toothbrush
1926 = To make this shiv I'm gonna need a toothbrush, a lighter and a blade. A toothbrush can be nicked, if I start working as a janitor. A lighter can be easily bought from a haggler. And in order to get a razor I may try to nick a safety razor from some of the guys in the shower. 
1927 = I should rustle up a toothbrush. First I was thinking about Boyd's toothbrush, 'cause he's always busy with some fuckin' stuff. But that poor thing's had enough torment. I'll try to nick someone else's toothbrush. In order to do this I'll have to start working as a janitor. 
1928 = Get the toothbrush
1929 = I entered one of the cells I had to clean. I immediately recognized the smell of the cologne there. In a few moments I remembered smelling that smell in the laundry. Looks like Aaron, one of Holland's sidekicks, was using it. That's his cell.  I'll take his toothbrush.
1930 = Take Aaron's toothbrush
1931 = Damn! I managed to discreetly hide the toothbrush in my belt. Some time later I heard that flaxen-haired con complaining about somebody having stolen his toothbrush. It serves you right, ficking' elephant! Now I need to think of how to get the blade.
1932 = As soon as I held out my hand to take the toothbrush, Aaron with some of his buddies entered the cell. I greeted him as if nothing had happened. Seems like they didn't notice anything, but that was a scary moment. 
1933 = Wet Pants drove me so freaking mad, I could hardly think. I truly hate weasels like him. Though I won't be able to do what I want on my own.
1934 = Get the blade
1935 = I know that some of the dudes shave themselves with safety razors in the shower. I need to somehow divert their attention, then I'll be able to nick somebody's razor. The only thing to decide is the way of doing it.
1936 = Create a diversion
1937 = I quietly took a roll of toilet paper and brought it to the shower. I tore off a few pieces of toilet paper there and crammed them into the drain. Now the only thing is to wait until this place gets packed with cons, so that the flood can begin.
1938 = Wait for the flood to begin
1939 = My plan worked and soon the showers were covered knee-deep with water. The cons started cursing, then the guards came, then the cons and the guards started shouting at each other. While everyone was yelling, I sneaked into the shower and saw a safety razor on the shelf. 
1940 = The showers were soon covered knee-deep with water. The cons started cursing, then the guards came, then the cons and the guards started shouting at each other. While everyone was yelling, I started sneaking around the showers, but didn't find a safety razor anywhere. 
1941 = Use a trick
1942 = I went to Aaron and told him that I'd heard one of the cons boasting about stealing a toothbrush from a big white dawg. Aaron rushed off right to the shower and started searching the cons' belongings.
1943 = Find a razor
1944 = While all the cons were making a fuss, I sneaked into the shower and saw a safety razor on the shelf.  Dumb Aaron didn't even suspect anything and kept shouting. Eventually I got tired of it and went back to my cell. Now I can start crafting the shiv. 
1945 = While all the cons were making a fuss, I started sneaking into the shower but couldn't find a safety razor anywhere. Eventually I noticed Aaron suspecting something, he started talking way too politely to the cons in the shower. It's high time I got out of there. 
1946 = Now everything's ready for the plastic shiv crafting! It's time for some hand work.
1947 = Make a shiv out of a toothbrush
1948 = Take a toothbrush, tear off the top part with the brush. Now warm the top part up with a lighter until the plastic part starts melting. Then put the blade inside and let it all dry very well. The shiv is ready!
1949 = Make a knife
1950 = In order to make a knife I'm gonna need duct tape, a piece of metal and a tool for sharpening. I can get duct tape from a haggler. Things are more difficult with a piece of metal. I have to think about distracting the guards while I'm sharpening it.
1951 = Think of how to distract the guards
1952 = One con from the infirmary, having been beaten senseless by some black guys, told me, that there was a con called Wet Pants in the ward nextdoor. That dude was a regular infirmary visitor, 'cause he was skilled at imitating epileptic seizures.
1953 = Talk to Wet Pants
1954 = "Hey, Mexican!" Wet Pants addressed me when I came up to him on the sports ground and explained what I needed. "You gotta know I'm a pro. I'm not gonna slave away for free. My price is 100 cigs.
1955 = That's too much!
1956 = "If the price is not OK for ya, shove off and don't distract me any more, fricking taco-eater!" Wet pants cried out.
1957 = You shove off, dumb gringo!
1958 = Fine, I agree
1959 = Deal!
1960 = I managed to obtain the support of the pseudo epileptic, now I gotta get some work in the workshop.
1961 = Make a knife
1962 = I'd rather smash Wet Pants' arrogant mug with a baseball bat, but I paid him 100 cigs instead and thanked him for helping me. In due time that bozo showed up near the workshop and started wandering in front of the door as if nothing was gonna happen.
1963 = Find a piece of metal
1964 = I took a look around. There are plenty of metalic items. I need to select one, out of which, it will be easy to make a knife. Let me see what there is. 
1965 = Examine the grinding table
1966 = The cons are grinding different stuff here in the course of the decorating process. I found a bunch of  sawdust, a few paintbrushes, but no metal at all. Gotta keep on searching.
1967 = Examine the grinding machine
1968 = I'm gonna need this thing when I find a suitable piece of metal. I noticed a metal brush, an old grinding wheel, some unknown things, and a few cutting tools. That's not what I need.
1969 = Examine the closet
1970 = I pretended to be taking new gloves out of the closet. Turner was absorbed with his telephone, so I could examine everything around me. Some rags, an old broom, a drawer with some garbage. It's not what I need.
1971 = I laid my eyes on a big grinding machine with a big white dipshit, Lil' Johnny, working on it. There was a perfect small piece of metal lying under one of its legs. That piece is easy to sharpen and easy to sneak. 
1972 = Move the grinding machine 
1973 = Ask Lil' Johnny for help
1974 = "Hey, amigo!" I said quietly to Lil' Johnny. "Do me a favor, help me move this machine a bit!" Lil' Johnny replied: "Oil and water don't mix, you moron. But if you give me 20 cigs, we may work something out." What a cheapskate, freck!
1975 = Pay Little Johnny 20 cigs
1976 = "Fine, take your cigs, big guy", I reluctantly gave Johnny the cigs. He took them away, made sure none was looking at us and lifted the machine with a groan. I rapidly took the piece of metal and hid it in my bosom.
1977 = Act on my own
1978 = I came up to the machine and, having made sure none was watching me, tried to move it a bit. The machine was awfully heavy, but I was strong enough to do it. I managed to take the piece of metal and hid it in my bosom.
1979 = I tried to move the machine, but it turned out to be too heavy. Although I was straining my every nerve, that damn thing din't move at all. 
1980 = Muy bueno, I've got some metal. It's time I sharpened it! If everything goes smoothly, I'll have a ready-to-use shiv in a couple of minutes. 
1981 = Give a signal
1982 = I found the right time and gave Wet Pants a signal. He came closer to the door of the workshop, made sure Turner was able to see him and fell down, imitating a seizure. 
1983 = Sharpen the piece of metal
1984 = I neatly sharpened the piece of metal on both sides. There were sparks all over, but everyone was so busy with Wet Pants' seizure that I was lucky to be unnoticed. That geezer is really good at what he's doing: half of the prison is watching him now. 
1985 = Tell the con to shove off
1986 = I took out the knife, spinned it a bit and told that creep to keep his mouth shut, otherwise he would  be sent to Columbia in a body bag.
1987 = The cholo said that he didn't mean anything offensive towards me, adding that Mexicans and Columbians are BFFs. I snapped at him several times more, just in case, until that moron shoved off. 
1988 = The cholo told me to shove off and said he was going to tell Turner everything that very moment. Damn, how I hate squealers! We need to decide on our plan of actions asap.
1989 = Pay 
1990 = Take the fight
1991 = Punch him in the face
1992 = Without saying a word I punched him in the mouth. Those greedy Columbian bastards have been creeping me out since Gregory and I were selling coke in the night clubs. Columbian chicks are pretty nice, though.
1993 = I hit that dumb bastard on the head a few times, then pulled the sharpened piece of metal out, and put it right to his throat. "Scream and you're dead. Got it?" That creep made it clear that he got it.
1994 = The con turned out to be more skillful than I thought, so he managed to escape my hit. Then he kicked me in the crotch with all his might. Everything went dark and I fell to my knees. The con took all my cigs and my shiv and said that I still owed him. 
1995 = Pay 20 cigs
1996 = "Bueno, here are the cigs. keep your mouth shut, otherwise you'll go back to Columbia piece by piece." The cholo took the cigs and shoved off.
1997 = Wet Pants' performance was about to finish, the cons led by Turner and nurse Jenny put him on the gurney and dragged it towards the infirmary, and I returned to my workplace happy as a clam. 
1998 = Not bad, but I still need to make another weapon. I'll use it if things go south, it might save my life.
1999 = Now I'm armed and dangerous. It's high time I had a good training. Some time ago Hulking Dan promised to show me some dogfight moves. Any help will be useful for me in that fight, even that of Hulking Dan.
2000 = Look for Dan
2001 = I went to the workout room, hoping to find Hulking Dan there. But on entering the hall I saw Boyd digging through Dan's belongings. Looks like he was snooping around. Suddenly it crossed my mind that Dan had done something to Boyd, too.
2002 = Wanna kill Hulking Dan?
2003 = Boyd barely crapped his pants at the sight of me. I gave him an idea to cut the bar with shears, then there'll be a chance for the barbell to fall on Dan's head. Perhaps, Boyd will rid the world of Hulking Dan without my assistance.
2004 = Go to the laundry
2005 = Dan was arguing with Aaron about which music band had more influence on world culture: the Beatles or Rolling Stones. Only honky gringos can seriously argue about it. Everybody knows that the best music ever is played by Los Lobos!
2006 = Be taught a lesson by Dan
2007 = I took a look around to make sure there were no ears listening to us, then I showed Dan my shivs. "Nicely done, Carlos!" Dan said.  "We'll go to some quiet place now and I'll teach you a few lessons on bare-knuckle fighting."
2008 = Nope, let's do it next time
2009 = "Fine, I'll wait until you bulk up a bit. Mexicans are tough guys, you gotta try hard to beat the crap out of them." Dan's right. I need to go to the workout room and to the court more often in order to survive the fight.
2010 = "Great, let's go to the workout room and I'll show you how to kick some butts." Dan led me to the workout room. Now he's gonna show me a few moves and I'll become a perfect killing machine.
2011 = When we came to the workout room there were some dull hicks. Dan told them to get out and a moment later the room was empty. As soon as the door shut Dan punched me on the face without saying a word. It happened so unexpectedly that I was clobbered.  
2012 = Remain sitting
2013 = Diablo. Perhaps, Dan somehow figured out that I wanted to whack him and decided to be the first to act? One more hit and I'll go to the fight with Mexicans in a wheelchair.
2014 = Try to stand up
2015 = Puta madre. If I get out of this shit alive, I'll make Hulking Dan pay for it. I imagined beating Hulking Dan with a baseball bat, and a smile appeared on my face.
2016 = "Rule number one", Dan said drawling. "Don't wait for a fair fight. We'll be attacked from the back, those lying on the floor will be beaten as well. You've got to keep an eye on everything around you. Got it?"
2017 = Stay put
2018 = I didn't move and Dan approached me. Before I knew it, he was squeezing my head with his giant hands. These moments made me feel sorry for getting involved in all that stuff. Dough is one thing, but I didn't sign up for anything like this!
2019 = Approach Dan
2020 = I made a few steps towards Dan, he grabbed my clothes and pulled me towards him. Then he grabbed my head with his giant paws. These moments made me feel sorry for getting involved in all that stuff. Dough is one thing, but I didn't sign up for anything like this!
2021 = "Temples, hollows behind the earlobes, Adam's apple." Dan was painfully pressing each of them. "If you hit your opponent right, you'll knock him out even if he's physically stronger. A dwarf like you should know this." What? Did he really call me dwarf?
2022 = "And the final thing. If several fighters are approaching you, you gotta figure out the strongest one and beat the crap out of him, as an example for the rest. Got it?" I nodded. "Good", said Dan. "Now let's move on to sparring."
2023 = Fine
2024 = "Don't be mad at me if I accidentally send you to the infirmary", I said to Dan while stretching. He just smiled and  prepared to kick my ass. That slugger will easily mop up the floor with me. I hope he doesn't have such intention.
2025 = Let's do it next time
2026 = "Are you wet all over? Fine, Lucke, go and work out. I'll be waiting until you are strong enough." Hulking Dan is right: I'm not ready yet. I gotta bulk up and exercise with a punching bag more often.
2027 = Dan jumped at me and made a jab with his right hand. I managed to dodge it and hit him in the body. I wasn't hitting too severely as to not make him angry, just in case. That very moment Dan shifted his balance onto his left leg, to kick me with his right leg.
2028 = Block Dan's hit
2029 = I managed to block and it saved my jaw from the punch. I noticed Dan looking at me with respect. Looks like I'm making progress.
2030 = I tried to block, but Dan's kick was so strong that I fell down. Dan took advantage of the moment and pinned me to the floor with his knee. I helplessly tried to move under Hulking Dan's weight. "Make it difficult for me to knock you to the ground." Dan said.
2031 = I bounced off and made a quick left cross. Dan didn't manage to react in time and  I punched him right in the ear. He got pretty angry because of that. He turned to me and started attacking.
2032 = Defend yourself
2033 = I was trying to block Dan. He kept punching me on and on. Seemed like I got hit by  the hailstorm, exept there were cast-iron stones instead of ice.
2034 = I managed to dodge Hulking Dan's punches. My arms became red and swollen while protecting me from those terrible blows. Well, at least my head is safe and sound, and I'm still on my two feet.
2035 = One of Dan's puches reached the goal. I felt his enormous fist hitting my jaw. The next moment I found myself on the floor. My mouth was full of blood. I spit out several teeth. "Go, get yourself fixed up", Dan said while and helped me to stand up. 
2036 = Run away
2037 = I thought Dan was too ponderous and I should use that weakness to my advantage. I started leaping over the room, forcing Dan to run after me.
2038 = I managed to hold out for quite a long time. Dan was out of breath and obviously tired of chasing me. I picked the moment and struck him several times in the body. 
2039 = At some point Dan managed to back me up against the wall. I was trying to resist him, but in vain. He was bashing me up until I started bleeding. He finally released me when I fell down, spitting with blood. "Get out, Lucke. Return when you get fixed up." 
2040 = I'm doing well! Dan looks tired. He roughed me up pretty good, but I'm still alive. Suddenly Dan rushed towards me and grabbed my arm. I didn't have enough strength to release myself, so I ended up lying on the floor.
2041 = Pull out the shiv
2042 = He can bump me off just like that. I managed to feel my shiv. If I threaten Dan, he'll shove off. In a last ditch effort I relesed my right arm and put the shiv to Dan's throat.
2043 = Dan stood still staring at me. I understood from his look that my preparation was over. "You're ready", Dan said and set me free. He held out his hand and helped me get back on my feet.
2044 = But before I knew it, Dan took my shiv away. The next moment he grabbed my head and hit it viciously against the floor. That horrible pain made me scream. "Lesson is over", Dan said, getting off me. "You're not ready yet." Puta madre. Man, I hate being beaten up!
2045 = Hit Dan with your head
2046 = Soon it was clear that this prick was gonna blow my brains out. I gotta do something! So, I managed to hit Dan with my head as hard as I could. 
2047 = The blow landed in his jaw. Dan screamed out in pain and fell down. He was rolling on the floor for quite a long time. Finally, he rose to his feet and held out his hand. "You're ready", he said.
2048 = The idea was nice, but my head barely touched Dan's chin. That only wound Dan up and he punched me in the head a couple of times. Finally Dan calmed down. "Get fixed up!" said Hilking Dan. I gotta find the way to defeat him.
2049 = "Come to the sports ground at night", Dan said. "Don't forget your weapon. It's gonna be hot!" I went to my cell to get ready for the fight. I checked the stash on my way, just in case, but there wasn't any parcel from Gregory. 
2050 = Ready, amigo!
2051 = Carry out a fight against Mexicans
2052 = In due time I left my cell and went to the sports ground. The prison administration prefers to stay out of the showdown between the gangs. They allowed us to make a big fight on the basketball court. The winner-gang was supposed to run the drug trade in the prison.
2053 = Go out on the court
2054 = Having fixed the shivs tightly with a duct tape on my body under my clothes, I headed towards my fellows standing on the left half of the court. Holland was here as well, but he wasn't going to take part in the fight. He came up to each of our fighters, patting our shoulders and cheering us up.
2055 = Get to know the opponents
2056 = There was a gang of Mexicans standing opposite us. Some of them were perplexed. "You must be wrong with your side, bro", said one of them in Spanish. "There will be no mercy for turncoats." Hulking Dan whispered: "Watch Cuervo." Cuervo was one of the most violent fighters among the Mexican cons. 
2057 = Start the fight
2058 = We are about to hear the signal for the fight to start. I kept looking at the opponents, trying to figure out whom to start with. Many of them were much stronger than me. If I stay alive, it will be a great piece of luck for me.
2059 = Check the shivs
2060 = I made sure that the shivs were tightly fixed and wouldn't injure me in case I fell down. All the sounds started to gradually fade out. My heartbeat increased. I made fists. The fight was about to start.
2061 = Mexicans came sprinting towards us. We rushed ahead as well. In no time I could feel the first hits. I was being punched by the Mexican called Rato. He had long arms and I could hardly avoid his punches. I gotta find the way to get closer to him and sweep him off his feet.
2062 = Trip Rato
2063 = I squatted down and struck Rato with a blow under his knee. Rato shrieked in pain and doubled over. I leaped back up and knocked him down with a direct shot to his nose. I heard the bone crunching. Looks like Rato was about to quit the game. 
2064 = Finish off the opponent
2065 = I started bashing Rato up with my feet. First he tried to stand up, then at least to crawl out, then he started begging for mercy. I punched him in the liver a few more times. Now he's no threat.
2066 = Move on to the next one
2067 = I took a look around. I was on the real battlefield. Some of the cons had already been lying facedown on the ground. I even noticed batons, metal wires and shivs going off. I gotta stay viligant.
2068 = Go baldheaded
2069 = I tried to hit Rato with my leg, but that shitbird managed to leap aside and punched me in the eye. I fell on my back, but managed to roll away. That trick saved my life,'cause the next moment Rato landed with all his weight on that very place, where I had fallen.
2070 = Keep on punching Rato
2071 = I went on and on, in spite of that Mexican's begging. That creep would gladly smash my head against the ground. Why should I feel sorry for him?
2072 = Take a look around
2073 = There were a few dozens of cons beating the crap out of each other. Some of them were already lying on the ground in their own blood. Looks like someone put some weapon to use. I have to be ready to act in the same way.
2074 = One of the Mexicans noticed me standing aside. He must have regarded me as an easy prey, because in a moment he was running towards me, flapping his hands about. That Mexican was bigger and obviously stronger that me. I gotta make up my mind asap.
2075 = Pull out a shiv
2076 = I understood that a weapon was necessary in that situation. I pulled out the first shiv and rushed towards the Mexican. One of us is gonna be severely hurt in a moment.
2077 = Step aside
2078 = When the Mexican came close enough, I made a misleading trick and leaped aside. While the con was trying to figure out what had happened, I stabbed him with a shiv. The Mexican made a choking sound and fell on his knees. The next moment he bit into my leg. It was a hellish pain.  
2079 = Strike
2080 = I ended up at arm's length and stabbed him with a shiv from the bottom up. Such a stab is almost impossibel to be blocked, so a moment later I felt that Mexican's blood flowing down my arm. He groaned with pain. I tried to pull the shiv out. 
2081 = Run away
2082 = I acted like a rabbit. The next moment the Mexican was chasing me, screaming like some animal on a hunt. That creep was a fast runner, so soon I realised that I couldn't get away from him. I stopped and turned to him, ready to fight.
2083 = Leap aside
2084 = When that Mexican was already close enough, I stepped aside. The con didn't manage to stop in time and ran a few steps more past me. I used these moments to hit him with a fist. It was successful. I punched him in the temple. He fell down. Looks like I managed to knock him out.
2085 = Stay put
2086 = When the con ran up to me close enough, I jumped up in the air and punched him with a leg on the face. He didn't manage to dodge, it struck him in the jaw. The Mexican fell down and started groaning, spitting out his blood.
2087 = The next moment I felt an enormously strong punch no my head. I was thown a few metres ahead. Everything went dark, I could hardly distinguish the figures of the cons fighting in front of me. But that one, who had hit me, was still right behind me. I had to act immediately.
2088 = Pretend to be dead
2089 = I almost felt passing out. I couldn't rise to my feet. Fine, I'll try to lie down. Perhaps, that one, who had hit me, would suppose I was dead and would shove off. But in a few seconds I was punched with a leg on the head. I didn't succeed in pretending to be dead.
2090 = Grab the attacker by the leg
2091 = In the moment of the next punch I managed to grab the opponent's leg. That turned out to be Gato, a smart-ass Mexican from the kitchen. Gato wasn't confused and started strangling me. I tried to throw him off me but in vain.
2092 = Crawl aside
2093 = I tried to crawl away from the attacker, hoping that he would shove off, but he kept pace with me. I raised my head and saw that the attacker was Gato, a smart-ass Mexican from the kitchen. Gato sat right on me and started strangling me. I tried to throw him off me but in vain.
2094 = Roll onto your back
2095 = I rolled onto my back and saw Gato, the smart-ass Mexican from the kitchen. That creep kicked me like hell.
2096 = Grab the attacker by the leg
2097 = I managed to wrap my fingers around Gato's ankle. I pulled his leg and he fell down near me. The son-of-a-bitch wasn't confused and took advantage of the situation by saddling me. He started strangling me. Hard as I tried, I couldn't release myself from his clinched fingers. 
2098 = Crawl away
2099 = I started crawling aside hoping that Gato would get rid of me. But that sumbitch had another point of view. When he got tired of kicking me, he sat right on top of me and started strangling me.
2100 = Suddenly Dan came to help me. Two leaps were enough for Hulking Dan to reach us. Then he punched Gato on the head as hard as he could until he started growling. At that very moment I saw the tough guy Cuervo with a shiv in his hand behind Dan's back.
2101 = Defend Dan
2102 = After that everything became very surreal. I rapidly pulled the shiv out. Then I pushed Dan aside. The next moment I stabbed Cuervo in the chest with that shiv. He managed to do the same thing. I felt the cold metal penetrating under my ribs. Unbearable pain shot through my whole body. 
2103 = Find out about Holland's third task
2104 = Some time later I started coming round after the fight with the Mexicans. My lads patched me up, some members of "the family" were constantly visiting me and bringing me some cool stuff. Once it was even a fruit basket. Besides the apples and oranges there was a note in the basket. 
2105 = Read the note
2106 = It said in a beautiful handwiritng: "Dear Carlos. I'm impressed by your courage. You've coped with your second task perfectly well. But in order to become a member of our family you need to visit me and get the instructions for the last task. I wish you a speedy recovery. J.H." 
2107 = Go to the laundry 
2108 = I decided to check the stash later. Honestly, I'm not about waving a gun in front of Holland's face. If he needs something from me, he won't kill me.
2109 = Check the stash
2110 = I started my usual walk along the fence. Then I sat down as if to fix the fastener on my boots, and unnoticeably checked my stash. The parcel's here! I took it carefully and hid it in my bossom. Looks like Gregory was good at performing his work. Now I can go to Holland.
2111 = Go to Holland
2112 = I came to the laundry. Hulking Dan was already there. He smiled and waved at me. Dumb creep. I also smiled and waved at him. "Carlos", the one-legged geezer shouted. "John is already there waiting for you." That geezer is the most ridiculous secretary I've ever seen.
2113 = Go inside the closet
2114 = I entered Holland's "office". He pointed to the chair opposite him. "Carlos", he started. "Let me express my gratitude for everything you've done for my family. Your help can't be overestimated." Why the hell is he so flowery? Can't he use simple words? 
2115 = It's an honor for me
2116 = I'll show you the way
2117 = And you're like a father to me
2118 = "The thing I want to ask you about is more than an ordinary request", Holland said and sat down on the chair next to me. "My business is based on three foundations: the highest quality of the product; commitment of each member of my family; reliability of my partners.
2119 = How am I to help you?
2120 = "Thanks for asking, Carlos. Unfortunately, there's one guy who wants to harm my family."
2121 = I'm ready to do anything that is needed
2122 = "I appreciate your willingness to protect the interests of my family, Carlos. You should know, there is one guy who wants to harm my family."
2123 = Get down to business
2124 = "I appreciate your willingness, Carlos. You should know, there is one guy who wants to harm my family.
2125 = Bob Wiglet, the security chief. A ratty vermin, living at the expense of my generosity. His only job is to turn a blind eye to some illegality of my activity in exchange for a generous remuneration."  
2126 = What do you want from me?
2127 = I left the closet and went to the laundry, where Dan had already been waiting for me. He said something, I replied something. Everything was like a nightmare.
2128 = Go to your cell
2129 = Some time ago my granny Ramona warned me against trusting people who speak with long sentences. She was a hell-of-a-clever person, my grandma. I sat down on the bunk and put my head in my hands. I had to make up a plan immediately. 
2130 = Go to the court
2131 = I went to the court to spend some time on my own and think everything over thoroughly. Suddenly I remembered that five years before that, when Stella had got pregnant, I'd seriuosly been thinking of bowing out. I even wanted to open a small restaurant.
2132 = Go to the common room
2133 = I went to the common room to entertain myself a bit and perhaps invent a rescue plan. My mother was a drunkard, but in those rare days when she was sober she used to talk about some curse upon our bloodline.
2134 = I have to concentrate on getting the omnicine recipe. Even if something happens to me, at least Angel will deliver the money to Stella, and our daughter will be financially set for life.
2135 = I'm gonna fight to the end. I've got a gun which I can use in case of necessity. I don't have to play Holland's game any more. It's time for me to figure out my own plan. 
2136 = I decided to check my stash and see if there was any parcel from Gregory. I started my usual walk along the fence. Then I sat down as if to fix the fastener on my boots, and unnoticeably checked my stash. 
2137 = "Kill Wiglet", said Holland calmly, as if he was talking of a visit to church. "Of course, you can count on Dan or anyone from our family." I couldn't believe my ears. Does he really want me to whack the security chief? Maybe the Pope as well?
2138 = Think of how to save yourself
2139 = Some time later I had a plan. I decided not to kill Wiglet. Perhaphs he's not saint, but he hasn't done anything to me personally. I pretended getting ready for the murder, and at the same time was figuring out how to get the omnicine recipe asap. 
2140 = Soon Hulking Dan started to realise that I was of little use. Very often I would refuse to do his tasks and pretended to be sick. In one of such days, when Boyd was wandering around somewhere and I was lying on the bunk, Dan came into my crib. He asked if I was OK. 
2141 = Stomachache
2142 = "You know what the munchies in the canteen consist of, amigo", I said. "People mustn't eat that shit. I spent half of the night sitting on the nightpot after that dinner. I'll have to skip today's training."
2143 = Caught a cold
2144 = "The drafts are so strong here that even rats are coughing", I said to Dan. "I spent half of the night with a terrible temperature, amigo. I'm not able to visit our training today."
2145 = Dan nodded and headed towards the exit. But instead of leaving, he shut the door, turned to me and started strangling me with his giant paws. I tried to resist, but in vain. Dan was strangling me and the only sound I could produce was grunting.
2146 = Clear
2147 = I nodded and a moment later passed out. I woke up on the floor with a bleeding nose. Obviously, Dan had thrown me off the bunk before leaving. I stood up staggering.
2148 = Spit in Dan's face
2149 = If I'm gonna kick off now, at least once I can do something for pleasure. I spat right into Dan's mug. He got mad and punched me with his fist as hard as he could. I fell off the bunk. Dan hissed: "One more trick like that and I'll unscrew your head", and left the cell.
2150 = Although, I could hardly move my legs, a plan appeared in my head, it was simple and brilliant like the song "La Bamba". Inspite of the taste of blood on my teeth I managed to smile. I have a chance to win this game. 
2151 = The only way to resolve it is to report Wiglet about the oncoming assassination. Even if the rest of my sentence I spend in SHU as a result, at least I won't have to murder the security chief! I just have to figure out in what way to deliver that information to Wiglet.
2152 = Write an anonimous note
2153 = If I find the way to write and give Wiglet that anonimous note, on which I'm gonna tell him Holland's plans and enlist everybody involved in the oncoming assassination, then I'll manage to get rid of all Holland's henchmen. But I'm mostly concerned about Hulking Dan. 
2154 = Inform in person
2155 = If I find the way to let Wiglet know about Holland's plans and enlist everybody involved in the oncoming assassination, then I'll be able to easily sneak into the lab and get omnicine's recipe. But first I'll take care of Hulking Dan.  
2156 = Hard as I tried, I didn't manage to figure out how to get rid of Dan. But some time later Eddie Boyd came up to me and told me about Hulking Dan being allergic to nuts. 
2157 = Figure out what's on Boyd's mind
2158 = Boyd told me the details of his plan: he wanted to slip Hulking Dan a candy bar with nuts. If his medical records don't lie, he'll kick off pretty soon. And if not, I'll be able to bump him off with my own hands.
2159 = Agree to Boyd's plan
2160 = I made a moody look for show and told Boyd I would help him if he paid me good money. On hearing my price Boyd showed dissatisfaction, but agreed. Looks like he's in real need.
2161 = Take time to think over
2162 = I'll pretend to be unenthusiastic about this. In this case it will be easier to charge him more. Boyd won't get away from me. I heard some guys in the shower talking about Boyd having some serious problems. I'm practically his only friend. Poor thing.
2163 = They say Boyd is after some figurines, and he has even nicked one from the Boss men. I have no idea why Boyd is doing this. My bunkie asked me to get the protein bar asap.
2164 = Promise Boyd to get the protein bar
2165 = Boyd had no idea that in one of my stashes there had already been a protein bar, which I had sneaked form the infirmary. I went there and pulled the protein bar out of the stash. The game started, and it's not me who's gonna be the victim.
2166 = I approached the telephone and called Gregory. After my last order Gregory got cold feet about me. I had to remind him that his business existed thanks to me. Gregory agreed to help me. I found a few protein bars in the stash under the prison fence. 
2167 = Inform Boyd about the success
2168 = Boyd was slightly stunned by the speed of my actions. "You bet, I'm the best at smuggling", I said to Boyd, so that he remembered whom he was dealing with.
2169 = Demand some more cigs from Boyd
2170 = Since I've managed everythung so quickly, I can trick Boyd into fifty more cigs. He agreed to pay in case our plan didn't work or something went wrong.
2171 = We agreed that I would feed Dan with that bar. And when he starts kicking off, Boyd will be able to cutt the figurine off his neck. I wasn't sure, I'd have the guts to bump Dan off. But at least I can send him to the infirmary.
2172 = Give Dan the protein bar
2173 = There were a couple of cons exercising in the workout room, whom Dan was explaining how to bench-press. I walked past the workout equipment and sat down on the bench opposite Dan. "Hey, hulk", I said. "You were right. I was being a total moron."
2174 = Hand it over to Dan
2175 = I handed the bar to Dan. He looked at me and burst out laughing. "Poor prick, Lucke. Do you relly think it will do you any good?"
2176 = Put in front of him
2177 = I put the bar on the bench in front of Dan. Dan looked at the bar, then he looked at me. "I'll take it", said Dan smiling. "But it's not gonna help you, moron."
2178 = "I know you're dealing double, Lucke", Dan said biting off a piece. "I don't know whom you're working for or what you want from Holland. He didn't believe me when I told him my thoughts about you. He needs you.  But not for long." Dan scratched his neck and coughed. 
2179 = I'm not a turncoat
2180 = "You won't fool me, Luke. I hear the smell of a rat." Dan's neck started to swell. His face turned red.
2181 = You have no proof
2182 = "We're not in court, moron!" Dan laughed. "I don't need any proof of your innosense to snap your neck. Sometimes I do it just for fun." I saw Dan turning red. 
2183 = "I'll kill you", I whispered. "What?" Dan didn't believe his ears. "You're dead, cabron", I said a bit louder. Dan fell to his knees and started to choke. He was gasping and wheezing. Boyd looked out of the door. I wonder, was he listening to our talk with Dan?
2184 = Strangle Dan
2185 = I squeezed Dan's neck with my fingers. Boyd tried to stop me, but then left. I was left face to face with Hulking Dan. I must kill him. Otherwise he'll kill me...I looked into Dan's eyes. He was afraid of dying. "Please... Don't", Dan whispered.
2186 = Release Dan
2187 = I pressed harder, but the next moment I realized that I wasn't able to follow through. I've never been a murderer and I'm not gonna become one now. My fingers unclenched. Hulking Dan took a deep breath. I gotta report about Holland's plans to the prison management.
2188 = Kill Dan
2189 = After everything that had happened I couldn't keep Dan alive. I squeezed his throat tighter. Dan groaned. In a few seconds he stopped breathing. I stood up and looked at my hands. I've just murdered a man. I rushed towards the exit of the workout room.
2190 = Report the assassination
2191 = I snuck into my crib and wrote a note, where I pointed out all members of "the family". The more of Holland's people will end up in SHU, the higher my chances of getting omnicine recipe are. Now I've got to figure out in what way to deliver this note to Wiglet.
2192 = Leave it in the corridor
2193 = This way is not very reliable, but less risky. I went to that part of the prison where Turner was on duty at that time. Exactly when Turner was about to turn the corner, I put the note on the floor and hid myself in the workout room.
2194 = I lay low and heard Turner stop. In a couple of moments he said "Oh, shit!" and rushed to the security chief's office. Looks like my plan has worked. 
2195 = Soon Turner headed right to the workout room. Turner opened the door, saw me and ordered me to follow him. He took me to Wiglet's office. He cuffed me in front of the door. After that Turner opened the door to the security chief's office. 
2196 = Put it under Wiglet's office door
2197 = Of course, that's quite a risky way, but more reliable. I went to that part of the prison where the security chief's office was situated. I wrote Wiglet's surname on the backside of the note, just in case. I slipped the note under the office door.
2198 = Some time later I looked out and noticed some fuss behind the glass of Wiglet's door. I heard loud footsteps in the corridor: it was Turner running to the chief's office as fast as he could. Perhaps he was radioed.
2199 = As soon as I did it the office door opened. There was Turner on the doorstep. "What the hell are you doing here, moron?" he said, and before I could say anything he pulled out a baton. Turner picked up the note and read it. "Come in", he hissed.
2200 = I headed right towards Wiglet's office. I understood, that a couple of minutes later I could end up in a more dangerous situation than at that time. But didn't care. I came up to the door and knocked. 
2201 = Tell Turner
2202 = "John Holland is preparing an attempt on security chief's life", I said quietly. "I may be murdered just for the fact of coming close to Wiglet's office. The longer I stay here, the the higher the risk for my life is." Turner entered Bob Wiglet's office.
2203 = Tell Wiglet
2204 = "No, sir. With all due respect I'll talk only with the security chief." Turner mumbled something, cuffed me and we entered Wiglet's office.
2205 = It was quiet in the office. There was a plump shorty sitting at the big table. Bob Wiglet. "What's going on?" he addressed Turner. "This con claims that you're in danger, sir." I sat down opposite Wiglet. "Who is it this time?"  he asked.
2206 = John Holland
2207 = Wiglet asked me to tell him everything I knew. I did. Turner wrote my every word down. Having listened to me, Wiglet thanked me and ordered to return to my cell. 
2208 = Ask for protection
2209 = "Sir", I started. "If there is at least one member of the family still out of SHU, I'll be in grave danger. They'll figure out pretty soon, who leaked all the information to them. "Don't worry about it, Lucke", replied the security chief. "You're safe from now on."
2210 = Ask about the punishment
2211 = "Mr.Wiglet", I started. "Members of "the family" will soon find out that it was me who told you about the assassination..." "Don't worry about it, Lucke", replied the security chief. "They'll go to SHU one by one immediately."
2212 = Turner sent me out of the office. I kept standing in the corridor for a little while, trying to figure out what had happened. They believed in my every word and even didn't throw me to SHU! I went to my cell, whistling the "Godfather" tune. 
2213 = Steal omnicine formula
2214 = Some time later I noticed some fuss in the quod. The guards were taking to the SHU all the cons, connected with the Family. The most impressive scene was Holland, being dragged along the prison corridor. I expected being grabbed as well, but it didn't happen. 
2215 = Go to the laundry 
2216 = When things died down I went to the laundry to do recon. There were some black cons working there, whom I'd never seen before. I wanted to check the entrance to the lab, but wasn't sure whether it was right to do it in the presence of those black ones.
2217 = Check now
2218 = I decided not to waste time and check the entrance immediately. The huge metal door was locked. Holy shit, how am I to open it?
2219 = Leave it till later
2220 = I decided not to do anything in front of these cons and check the entrance to the lab after all of them leave. When I returned there at the end of the shift, I saw that the huge metal door to the lab was locked. I'll have try hard to open it.
2221 = To open the lab I may try to use  a crowbar or a wire. Also I gotta get a flashlight in case there is no light in the lab. I can buy a flashlight if I [green]go to the haggler[/green] or steal it from the [green]staff room[/green].
2222 = With a crowbar
2223 = ""
2224 = I came to the gym and saw a piece of rebar. I unscrewed it from the sports equipment and spinned it a bit in my hands, looking thoroughly at it. It will be perfect as a crowbar! I can go to the door of the lab and try to crack it.
2225 = ""
2226 = I came up to the door of the lab with a crowbar in my hands. A few skilfull movements and the door opened with a squeaky noise.
2227 = With a wire
2228 = ""
2229 = Finally I'm done with the door! I hope I'll manage to get the omnicine recipe now. I don't have much time, only until workers of the next shift come to the laundry.
2230 = Hard as I tried to cope with the lock, I didn't succeed. I gotta have some rest. Come back here later and start fresh.
2231 = Leave it till later
2232 = I'll try to get some tool to crack the door. If I [green]go for a jog in the yard[/green], [green]go to the court[/green] or [green]work out in the gym[green], I may find a metal stick there and crack the door with it. I can also try to get some wire, if [green]I go to the haggler[/green], and try to crack the lock on the down low.
2233 = Enter the lab
2234 = It was pretty dark in there. I felt the acid smell of the chemicals. I had noticed a few coughing cons in the Holland's surrounding before. Perhaps, the reason for this was their work in the lab. I took a look around, but could see no respirators.
2235 = Examine the lab
2236 = The newest equipment was all around the lab. Looks like the process was automated, there was a sound of bubbling liquid coming from one of the pots. Someone had invested millions in this lab. Now I see why only the chosen ones allowed here.
2237 = Search near the pots
2238 = I walked past the big thermochemical pots. Some of them were hot. I took the lid off one of them and looked inside. The pot was filled with acid. 
2239 = Search in the air-oven
2240 = I came up to the air-oven and opened it. It was empty. It's my fist time in a place like this. No idea where to look for the recipe.
2241 = I was almost desparate trying to find anything useful here, but then I laid my eyes on the journal, lying near one of the pots. I came up to the pot and took the journal in my hands.
2242 = Flip through the magazine
2243 = I suppose, someone was describing the results of the chemical experiments here. I read: "The usage of acetyl chloride in stead of the acetic acid increases the concentration of O by 5%". Do they use "O" for "omnicine" here? 
2244 = Find a recipe
2245 = There was an inscription "Stages of production" on one of the pages. The formula was here too! I tore out that page. Finally, I had the omnicine recipe! I folded that sheet in half and put it in my pocket.
2246 = Go to the exit
2247 = I headed fot the exit of the lab. I felt like dancing with joy. But the sound of heavy footsteps coming from the laundry made me stop. Someone entered the lab. I saw Hulking Dan standing on the doorstep.
2248 = Search the table drawers
2249 = I squatted down, opened one of the table drawers. Suddenly I heard the sound of footsteps coming from the laundry. I saw Hulking Dan standing on the doorstep of the lab.
2250 = "I know you're here, Lucke!", Dan said. "Come out. Let's talk." Diablo! I was sure Dan would be in the infirmary for at least a few weeks!
2251 = Approach Dan
2252 = Perhaps, if I approach Dan we'll be able to make a deal. Holland and company are in SHU. Dan has no master any more.
2253 = I took a few steps towards Dan. Having seen me, he clinched his fists. "Lucke. You suprised me. Too many times."
2254 = We need to make up
2255 = "Holland used both of us. But he's gone", I said. Dan burst out laughing. I didn't like that. "You'll be gone as well very soon, dirty Mexican!", on saying this Dan threw down on me.
2256 = Lie down
2257 = "Lost somethin'?" asked Dan in his mocking manner. He was looking directly at me. Diablo. "We don't have to be enemies", I said to Dan. "No. But I just want you to die!" on saying this Dan threw down on me.
2258 = I tried to run away, but you can't run too far while you're still in the lab. Soon I was at the wall. Dan was running at me. I gotta figure out something quick.
2259 = Step aside
2260 = I took a few steps to the right. If I timed everything correctly, Dan won't be able to stop in time.
2261 = Dan tried to grab me, but didn't manage to stop in time and ended up hitting the wall. That trick gave me a couple of moments to squeeze through the narrow space between the thermo-pots.
2262 = Dan was able to forsee my trick and managed to grab me. Both of us fell down. I hit my head on a metal handrail. I felt blood running down my cheek. I got up and run towards the narrow space between the pots.
2263 = Blow off steam
2264 = I noticed a panel with a few dozens of switches above my head on the wall. I chose the one which I thought would blow off steam from the pipe above Dan, and pulled it down.
2265 = A fine hot mist shot out and reached Dan's head. Dan screamed and covered his eyes with his hands. The next moment he crashed into a metal handrail. Meanwhile I moved by feel towards the narrow passage between the pots. 
2266 = But nothing happened. Dan bumped into me and we fell down. I hit my head badly on a handrail. A moment later I felt blood running down my cheek. I got up and run towards the narrow space between the pots.
2267 = Dan prepared himself for the next attack. If I let him get me, I'm dead. I took a quick look around. There was a pot with acid on my right. If I push it in Dan's direction, he'll have no way out.
2268 = Push the pot
2269 = I opened the lid of the pot with one hand and pushed it towards Dan. Weird green liquid, resembling acid spilled out right on Dan. Dan's arms and face became covered with blisters. "I'll kill you!" he cried out. 
2270 = I romoved the lid of the pot and tried to knock it over Dan, but I was too weak. The pot didn't move at all. Dan was running right at me. I gotta figure out how to knock him out!
2271 = Throw an extinguisher
2272 = I ran up to the wall, grabbed the extinguisher and threw it at Dan. right into bull's eye! Dan fell face down.
2273 = Hit with a shovel
2274 = I grabbed a shovel from the wall and smashed Dan's head with it. The hit was so strong that Dan was launched a few metres. He fell face down.
2275 = I won't check whether Dan's still breathing or wait until he comes around. I ran towards the the exit of the lab. When leaving, I shut the door tight. Now I need to call Angel and arrange a meeting.
2276 = I went towards the exit of the lab. Finally I reached my goal! Now I have to call Angel asap and arrange a meeting.
2277 = Nope. I'll better stay here. I feel strongly Dan's not really into talking.
2278 = Talk to Angel
2279 = I went to the phone booth to call my boss. Finally I have good news for him. Some voice on the other end of the line said: "Hello, what the hell d'you want?" I laughed. It was Angel's usual manner of answering calls.
2280 = Hola, amigo!
2281 = "Damn, I thought you'd kicked off!" Angel said. "I was freakin' close to it at times", I replied. Although Angel was the main reason why I had to rack my head in that story with Holland, I was glad to talk to him.
2282 = Is our plan still if effect?
2283 = "Yes, Carlos", replied Angel. "If you got what I asked you about, I'm ready to come right now." I started thinking. What is the guarantee that Angel is not gonna trick me again? Not any. "I need a prepayment", I said.
2284 = I've got what you need
2285 = "It's the best news this year, goddammit!" said Angel. "I'm heading out now." But I knew that Angel couldn't be trusted. "No, Angel", I said. "I need a prepayment."
2286 = "There's no prepayment in our business", Angel answered. "I was risking my life to get this shit. This piece of paper in my hand will make you rich. If you wanna get it, you'll have to pay me first." - "Fine. How much?"
2287 = 500 thousand
2288 = "Deal", Angel said as soon as I voiced the sum. I immediately realised that I had made a bad bargain. I could've charged him much more, because omnicine recipe is the most valuable thing in the world of the drug trade. 
2289 = 750 thousand
2290 = "What if you slip me some crap instead of the recipe?" Angel shouted with outrage. I kept a dramatic pause. "Well, I'll easily find another buyer." - "No, no", Angel quickly backed up. "I agree on 750 thousand."
2291 = 1 million
2292 = "Shove off, Lucke!" Angel hung up. I picked my teeth, had a small chat with a con from the neighboring phone booth, and looked at the clock. Five minutes passed. I dialed Angel again. "Let it be your way", he said.
2293 = "You must deliver that money to Stella. When my wife gets the whole sum, you'll be able to come to East Castle and get the recipe." "Your ex-wife", Angel grumbled and hung up on me. Angel and Stella have always disliked each other. 
2294 = Go to the cell
2295 = I took a bottle of whiskey out of the stash, layed down on the bunk, took a few sips and started thinking about life being a weird thing. Today I became the richest con in East Castle. 
2296 = Talk to Boyd
2297 = I looked down from the top bunk. Boyd was lying below, I understood from his look that he was dreaming again about something. "Hey, compandre!" I said and handed booze to my bunkie. 
2298 = You don't belong here, Boyd
2299 = I told Eddie that things for him were getting worse. I was about to tell Boyd to hire a good lawyer, who would get him transferred to another prison, but didn't. He knew all that. Gentile and Boyd had something in common, I thought.
2300 = Leave the cell
2301 = Boyd was looking at me, as if I was the first man on the Moon. It seemed to me that by helping Boyd I sort of make amends to Archie. That made me feel good. And I gotta call Stella and find out whether she has received the money.
2302 = Call Stella
2303 = Some time later I came up to the phone booth and dialed the number I knew by heart. Stella answered in a sleepy voice. I apologized for waking her up. Then we kept silent for a little while. "You alright?" she asked.
2304 = Has Angel brought the money?
2305 = "Yes", replied Stella. "If this money is somehow connected with drugs..." "No", I interrupted Stella. "This money is clean." Stella kept silent. I remembered how often she used to be hurt because of me. Someday I will fix everyhting. 
2306 = Hang up the phone
2307 = I was standing there for some time, squeezing the handset with my hand. "Inmate Lucke. You have a visitor!" I heard from the loudspeaker. That must be Angel.
2308 = Go to the visiting room
2309 = Angel was sitting at one of the tables. "Lucke, you look like an old man. Where's your smile?" I gave him the formula. We agreed, that he would bring the rest of the sum to Stella in three days time.
2310 = Go to the cell
2311 = I left the visiting room and headed for my cell. "Carlos", Turner called me. "The warden wants to see you in his office. Follow me." Did Turner really call me by name? Why does Wiglet want to see me? Strange.
2312 = Go to Wiglet
2313 = On our way to Wiglet's office Turner was exchanging jokes with other guards. Turner opened the door of Wiglet's office: "Bob's waiting for you", Turner said and patted me on the shoulder. Looks like we're becoming friends.
2314 = Enter Wiglet's office
2315 = The curtains on the windows were closed. "Hello, Carlos," I heard. That wasn't Wiglet, but the voice seemed familiar to me. But how is that possible?..
2316 = Stop
2317 = I froze for a moment. The voice was coming from the left. I turned towards the corner of the office where the sofa for the visitors was situated.
2318 = Go deep into the office
2319 = I made a few more steps to the window to figure out where the voice was coming from. I turned towards the corner of the office where the sofa for the visitors was situated.
2320 = There was Holland sitting on the sofa. "You look great. Prison meals did you good", Holland said. what the hell is going on there? Where's Wiglet? "You must be wondering about many things. I'll try to help you figure everything out." 
2321 = Run to the exit
2322 = As I made a step towards the exit, I noticed a ghoul standing in the opposite corner. He had a gun with a silencer in his hand. It was directed at me. "Not so fast", Holland said. "Please, take a seat. Let's talk like old friends."
2323 = Throw a vase at Holland
2324 = As I reached out for the vase with flowers, I noticed a ghoul standing in the opposite corner. He had a gun with a silencer in his hand. It was directed at me. "Better take a seat, Carlos. Let's chat" Holland said.
2325 = Dude in the suit pressed the gun against the back of my head. "Mr.Holland", he said. "Get over to the window. I wouldn't like to dirty you with his brains." "No", Holland stopped him. "We haven't talked yet. Carlos has to know."
2326 = To know what?
2327 = "I've always liked you", Holland started. "You're mentally quick. Reckless enough. These are all the qualities, that I appriciate in my people. The problem is that you've never been one of my people. You used worked for Angel Carreras."
2328 = Deny everything
2329 = "I don't understand, what you are talking about", I said and shrugged my shoulders. "Really. Well. Let's listen", having said this Holland took the tape recorder from the table and pressed the play button. 
2330 = Agree
2331 = "I know Angel", I said and shrugged my shoulders. "But he is not my boss. We're old friends." - "Oh, that means you did hime a friendly favor, didn't you?", having said this Holland took the tape recorder and pressed the play button. 
2332 = "... And this piece of paper in my hand will make you rich. If you wanna get it, you'll have to pay me the advance." That was my own voice. Holland pressed the button. "All the phone calls are being recorded. It's very convenient." 
2333 = What do you want?
2334 = "Nothing. Thanks to you I got everything I wanted" he said. I felt helpless. I couldn't understand anything. But a gun pointed at me didn't presage any happy end.
2335 = What will happen to me?
2336 = "Don't hurry, Carlos. First things first. Don't you want to understand the magnitude of the game you've taken part in?" A gun, directed at me presaged that my role in this game would soon change to that of a victim.
2337 = "I've been hunting Angel for a long time. He was constantly creating roadblocks for me. But you brought Angel to me. At this very moment my people are burying his body in the woods. Now I don't have any rivals in this part of the country." 
2338 = What about the formula??
2339 = "Fake omnicine's formula, manhunt for my people, SHU, all that was a bait for you and your boss", said Holland. Seems like, he took real pleasure from torturing me. 
2340 = What about Wiglet?
2341 = "Oh, Wiglet's murder was supposed to be real. Actually Bob started asking for too much. It's a pity, you killed Dan. I had to call my good friend to finish this case", Holland nodded towards the dude in the suit. 
2342 = How long have you known this? 
2343 = "As soon as you tried to get some information about Archie's family. He came to me that very day and reported you'd been interviewing him. Archie, Dan... I feel sorry for their deaths..."
2344 = "Sir, isn't it easier to finish him off right now?", dude with the gun asked. Holland shook his head. "Every person, when faced with death, deserves to know what's brought him to such consequences", said Holland. 
2345 = Where is Wiglet?
2346 = "I have saved it for the last." On saying this Holland turned Wiglet's chair around towards me. Wiglet was sitting in the chair with his throat cut open. His dead eyes were staring at the ceiling.  
2347 = "Lucke сut Wiglet's throat open with a shiv", Holland was imitating the intonation of a newscaster. "The offender was killed with two shots in the chest by the guard, who arrived at the crime scene..." I sprang to feet.  
2348 = Shoot the gun 
2349 = I rushed to the dude in the suit. I'll try to knock the gun out of his hands...The dude struck me in the temple with the gun. I fell on the floor and suddenly saw Turner stood on the doorstep with a gun in his hands.
2350 = Run to the door
2351 = I reached the door in two steps. The killer jumped to his feet. He was holding me at gunpoint, but didn't shoot. I opened the door. Turner was standing on the doorway. And he had a gun in his hand.
2352 = "Officer Turner!" I shouted. "Please, help me!" Turner took a thorough look at everyone who was in the room. " I've always wanted to do this", Turner said and shot me in the chest. 
2353 = Crawl towards the exit
2354 = I tried to move, but I couldn't. I felt life slipping out of me. Someone leaned over me. I felt the shiv being put into my hand. 
2355 = Go to the cell 
2356 = I dozed off on the bunk, and woke up from somebody hitting my face with a newspaper. I jumped up from the bunk, eager to punch the boor. But it was Turner. «Rise and shine motherfucker", he said. "Work is waiting."  
2357 = I came to lab's door with a wire in my hands. Let's see now what's what. 
2358 = Gato drove a hard bargain. I'll have to save up some cigs, and then it will be possible for me to persuade this shitbird to help me. 
2359 = Deal with Gato
2360 = Still can't believe that this creep dared to trick me. Now I will go to Gato and make pay.
2361 = I can try to open the safe on my own, or I can look for the key. What's better?
2362 = Hack the lock
2363 = I used to crack safes like this in no time. Let's check if I still have some juice left.
2364 = The safe cracked open. I searched the safe with my hands trembling and found the cat figurine in it.
2365 = It didn't work. Either I find the key right now, or I'm doomed. I gotta do it faster!
2366 = Look for a key
2372 = "No, Boyd, that was a shitty story." Meanwhile Sarah cocked the pistol and put the gun into my hand. "Too bad, Harry. I was hoping you would be grateful to the hunter, who told you the parable."
2373 = I gotta do something really smart. I need to find out what Dan's weakness is. I've noticed Hulking Dan getting special meals in the canteen. I gotta find out why. I should go to [green]work in the kitchen[/green].
2374 = "Did you like my parable, Boyd?"\n"Yes."\n"Then, I think, you won't be so stingy with a couple of cigs for the hunter, who told you the parable." 
2375 = Dios mio, his moaning’s gonna make me sick. But I’ve got to keep my promise, since I’ve signed up for this. Having got up, I took Novak’s shiv. Now Carlos Lucke’s gonna show his true worth…
2376 = Novak fetched me some thread. He had no idea what I was doing. He surely wanted to ask me about that, but I didn't care about Novak at all. I had my own business here...
2377 = Eventually we heard a signal, marking the end of the cell checking. My cellmate gave me 20 cigs and I went out.
2378 = Personally I regarded it as crazy talk, but I had to agree to Angel's terms. He promised to double my savings and to make sure that all my money come to my ex-wife and my daughter.
2379 = "Take your bones to the canteen. You'll find Archie Gentile there, it's your new sidekick. He'll fill you in on the details!" Right, work. That's how they call the humiliating slave labor here. I headed for the canteen. Gotta get something to eat.
2380 = "Hasta la vista, Lucke! Try not to croack, I won't enjoy being left alone", Archie cried out and disappeared in the crowd. I was left face-to-face with taco and my thoughts about the best smuggler on both sides of the border shoveling all this shit. Shoot me.
2381 = I've got strained relationships with the screws, however the nurse from the infirmary doesn't look like a shrew. Perhaps, if I get into the infirmary and spend at least one night there, I'll manage to find something out.
2382 = Vinegar can be there as well! I tried to open the door, but it was locked. I suppose that Claw has a key from this cupboard. I should ask Claw to give me the key, sometimes long shots happen...
2383 = Once I left a packet of dope for a couple of hours in a safe just before room cleaning. Imagine my surprise when having returned I noticed a sheriff and several cops standing near my door. 
2384 = It looked like the maid in the hotel also knew the right combination and opened the safe while I was away. Though insted of the money or jewelry she found a couple ounces of coke. Anyway, why not try the combination right now!
2385 = Next ten minutes of our discussion were devoted to our family issues. I got to know that my cousins Claudia and Juanita had babies, uncle Sergio got married again and my cousin Arles went to jail for robbery. Finally it's time to get to the point...
2386 = Oh, boy. He was tortured. Unlucky man. Boyd was walking back and forth for some time more, then he asked me about the phone booth. Looks like this dude, in his turn, is not telling the whole truth as well. Anyways, I have to find Dan to figure out what to do next. 
2387 = And 'the ignorant degenerate' was sitting on top of Larry and was beating him with a botanic handbook. While the other cons were watching that drama, I quietly nicked the scissors out of the drawer.  
2388 = I quickly hid the razor in my clothes, then I started watching some cons cleaning the drain. Eventually I got tired of it and went back to my cell. Now I can start crafting the shiv.
2389 = Finally, the screws forced me and some other cons to clean the drain from the pieces of toilet paper and other rubbish. I nearly got sick of all that shit. I returned to the cell dog-tired and in a nasty mood.
2390 = This talent turned out to be very useful in prison, 'cause sick cons are supposed to get better munchies,  and anyway it's more pleasant to be in the company of a pretty nurse than in the cell with stinky cons. I decided to talk to Wet Pants and see how we could help each other.
2391 = Turner was on duty in the workshop at that time, and I was keeping watch because I knew that security chief was just waiting for the moment to punch me with a baton. I need to find a piece of metal unnoticeably and give a sign for Wet Pants to distract Turner until I sharpen it.
2392 = For the first few hours none could get what was going on, and then all the cons ran to watch the performance. Turner ran up to Wet Pants and started applying first aid: he pressed Pants' tongue, so that he didn't swallow it, that's all. I immediately ran up to the machine. 
2393 = When I was about to return to my place, some cholo turned up from nowhere and said that he had seen me steeling a piece of metal and then sharpening it on the machine. His silence cost me 20 cigs. What a creep!
2394 = "Comprendo", I mumbled. Suddenly I notice Dan raising his arm for the next punch, but I reacted immediately and leaped off. Dan's fist passed by my head within a few inches. "Fine. You've learned the lesson." Sure, moron. Wait for my blowback. Soon. "Come closer," said Dan.
2395 = When Holland came up to me, he held out his hand: "I'm proud of you, sonny", he said in such a solemn tone as if he was presenting me a Medal of Honor. "Show me the best you can do. We'll win." That damn thug will be standing aside, watching us kiiling each other. 
2396 = That sumbitch is fighting it tooth and nail. I sprang to my feet and ran at Rato. I managed to Knock him down. We were rolling in the dust for some time, preventing each other from getting up. I was the first one to do it. I was kicking him on and on, until he begged for mercy.
2397 = Then I passed out. When I came around, Aaron and Dan were dragging me along the prison corridor. "Who won?" I asked. "We did", replied Dan. "Hold on, Mexican, we're gonna patch you up now." I smiled and everything went dark again.
2398 = Damn! I almost kicked the bucket because of him, and still it's not enough! Well, that's that, I'll have to head for the laundry. By the way, the parcel with the weapon may have already come. I gotta go to my stash near the prison fence and check it. 
2399 = Holland started walking around that small closet as if it was an office with a panoramic view in Manhattan. " I want you to know: I don't trust this sort of things to strangers", said Holland. "But you are like a son to me."
2400 = Although there was no reason for me to worry about the first two points, the third one caused partucular trouble for me. I need your help to bring my business back on the way of sustainability and prosperity." What a windbag! When will he stop his jibber-jabber and gets down to business?
2401 = But at that time Angel appeared down the line, he offered me a new scheme of coke transportation, according to which I was able to earn a lot more than on my previous job. I could have avoided all that frickin' stuff, I could have been frying sausages for urban fat cats instead of it.
2402 = She predicted that I'd be shot, whereupon I would buy her a booze just to shut her up. I put my head in my hands. Whom are you trying to fool, Lucke? You got yourself into that shit not because of a family curse, but due to being a dimwit.
2403 = The parcel's here! I took it carefully and put it in my bosom. This time it was heavier than usually. Looks like Gregory did his work quite well. Now I have a gun, which I can use in case of necessity. It's time I made my own plan.
2404 = I went to the laundry a few times and every time I bumped into someone from the family. The entrance to the lab was guarded day and night. If I want to get there, I need to get rid of all Holland's men. 
2405 = "Archie was behaving himself just as you are now, Lucke", said Dan quietly, squeezing my neck with his fingers. "You know the end of the story. I hate sissies, Carlos. But I hate being let down even more. You have a task which you're gonna carry out anyway. Is that clear?"
2406 = "Fine, Lucke", said Dan indifferently, keeping on lifting weights. "I've got something for you", I said. "I remember you asking me about some protein bars, and I still didn't get it for you. I decided to fix this." I was fiddling the bar, without knowing what to do.
2407 = While Dan was writhing in pain on the floor and the other cons ran for help, Boyd cut the figurine off Dan's neck. I came up to Dan and sat down next to him. Boyd shouted at me so that I got out of the workout room. I leaned over to Dan.
2408 = "What the hell are you doing here?" Turner shouted on seeing me from across the corridor. "I've got some important information for Mr.Wiglet" I replied. Turner came very close with his eyes staring at me. "Speak, inamte!"
2409 = His manner of lollygagging about important things, as if it was about buying some vegetables for lunch, reminded me of the times, when we were transporting coke across the border and were making vast plans for future.
2410 = We were sort of daydreaming all the time. We both were decent guys. I wanted to help Boyd, to do something good for him. On second thought, I gave my gun to him. I'm not gonna need it any more.
2411 = "Stella?" I said. "What if we have dinner together sometime? When I get out of here?" - "Sure, but you're not gonna do another taco night, are you?" she replied and laughed. I wanted to tell her I missed her and Camilla, but I didn't. Another time.
2412 = I fell on the floor. Turner pointed the gun at me and shot one more time. The second shot did cause any pain. I tried to scream, but it didn't work out. The lights started fading rapidly. 
2413 = "Tell Jay-Jay, personal grudge should be the main version", said Holland. "And take care of fingerprints". Holland left the office. There was still the sound of his footsteps in the corridor for a little while. And then the silence fell.
