195="One of the inmates asks me for a favor. He wants me to craft a shank while I’m working on my shift in workshop. Might be dangerous but a serious amount of cigs is involved."
196="I need to get hooked up or I’ll be crawling on the walls pretty much soon..."
197="He was stronger than me and knocked me out as soon as I rushed on him. He held me on the floor waiting for the guards to show up. I was still trying to kick him even when they were dragging me out of there. I even bit a guard. They threw me in solitary but even there it took me some time to calm down.

204="I found a kitchen knife behind the fridge. Hah! Seems like nobody’s ever known it’s out there. The screws surely won’t be looking for it if I take it. If only I could sneak it out of here."

211="Some thugs showed up right in front of me. Their leader, a tough looking schmuck, is telling me that I owe him. I either pay up or I’ll get beaten. The screws are keeping an eye on us but I can try to knock out the bastard, nobody else will interfere."
212="The haggler has nothing for me today. Sucks!"
213="I finished my meal and hid a plastic fork in my pocket. The guards haven’t noticed and I was able to sneak it out."
214="I tried to calm down but the next moment I was lying on the floor with this hulk on top of me. The screws saw that it was me who started the fight and decided to keep me locked up in the SHU."
215="I called my relatives and heard the bad news."
216="Shit didn’t go smooth this time. The bastard beat the hell out of me in a second. My goons interfered and he got the same but I’ve lost my reputation of a badass. Others weren’t kean on paying up after this as well so we didn’t get a lot of this raid."
217="I was able to snatch a pack of cigs from an another inmate’s cell. I may be a rat but I’m rat with cigs now. I finished my shift and went straight to my cell."
218="I’ve hid in my cell and got high as heavens. I’ve spent a couple of hours in my bed and realised that things aren’t so bad after all. It turned out to be the last pack of dope that I had though."
219="I tried to snatch a plastic fork after I’ve finished with my meal but one of the screws busted me and took it away. Gave me a nice punch in the face as well. Asshole."
220="I asked the guards to pass the figurine as a gift to the Warden. Later one of them told me that he was very pleased. Though other inmates were looking at me like I kissed his ass or somethin."
221="I called my friend on the outside and he agreed to visit me."
222="I tried to sneak past the guards with a metal strip in my pocket but they happened to search me before I could leave. They’ve found the metal I was carrying but I found my way around fooling them. They confiscated the metal strip but I didn’t end in the SHU. I need to be careful next time anyway."
223="A gorilla-like screw pushed me to the wall.\n - Show me your pockets inmate! I saw a shank in your hands! - he was yelling right in my face. He had a strange stench coming out of his mouth like a bunch of vermin died there."
224="I cut my arm while I was working my shift in the workshop. Had to finish my shift earlier and go to the infirmary. Still hurts."
225="I was able to stay cool and calm down. Yelling at him did actually help. It’s better than spending time in the SHU."
226="I got nervous and let it slide this time. I gave him everything we scraped so far and now my cellmates seem really disappointed. So am I."
227="Get a pair of scissors"
228="I walked straight out of there not even listening. Maybe someone will die tomorrow but it’s not my business. A con more, a con less, who cares anyway?"
229="I decided to rest a while in my cell. I remembered that I took a book from the library. I’ve spent the day reading and felt much better. I actually felt myself smarter after reading. At least it seemed to me."
230="I got beaten for real and after that he took everything I had. My mates were disappointed but at least I tried to stand up in a fight and didn’t let it slide easily."
231="The showers were stuffed like a can of sardines and a bunch of inmates were standing in line. One of the inmates saw me and let me take his place in the line. Nothing better than a nice hot shower. The screws weren’t happy about me bullying other inmates though."
232="I went to the common room and was just in time for my favorite TV show. I was able to rest a while watching it."
233="With no smokes around I get real itchy. Either I drop this shit or I need to get a pack and a lighter."
234="An old friend of mine from the outside visited me here. We talked about recent business and other stuff. At the end of visitation time he passed me a small package with some goods in it and I was able to sneak it in."
235="After a while the guard returned with some plastic bottle. It had bear in it though the taste was like he took piss in it. Anyway that was something and cheered me up."
236="Shaking down the block didn’t give much. We were able to scrap a couple of bucks but that was it. Me and my mates were a bit pissed but there’s nothing we could do about it. We need to get more authority here."
237="Turned out that he wasn’t fooling around afterall. I took some beating and my goons had to intervene. The rest didn’t pay up after my deal with this guy."

241="- Damn, I need cigs fast. Alright, chill. I’ll think of something. Thanks anyway. - he then went to talk to an another group of inmates. Looks like he really needs them."
242="An old friend of mine from the outside visited me here. We talked about recent business and other stuff. At the end of visitation time he passed me a small package with some goods in it and I was able to sneak it in."
243="I took the cooking process in my hands and offered to cook something special not the usual crap we fed others with. It took some time and effort but we managed to cook a delicious meal. I think others from the block will be surprised by the treat."
244="I kicked their asses real good this time and now nobody’s going to mess with me."
245="I agreed to help him and made a nice shank during my shift. The screws were busy playing cards so they haven’t noticed anything and I was able to sneak it out of the workshop and got my payment. Beautiful."
246="I was working in the laundry till the evening. The stench of bleach and dirty clothes made a bit sick in the end but luckily I’m fit enough not to drop on the floor from this shit."
247="I’ve talked to the guards a bit and they don’t seem that bad after all. And anyone thinking I’m kissing their asses can go screw themselves."
248="I went out unnoticed to the yard and sterted walking along the fence. Some time later I noticed a package. There was whiskey in it."
249="The guards searched me but didn’t find anything. Fools."
250="Fetch an item"
251="It was easy enough to cut a small wire with the shears I had with me. This could be useful."
252="- Perfect. Talk to me when it’s done. I’ll be waiting. - he went to mind some other business."
253="I was clumsy enough to cut myself with a knife while I was working in the kitchen. Doc said it would take a while to heal."
254="I had a bet with some bull in the yard that I could do 100 push ups. Didn’t even break a sweat and earned my 5 cigs."
255="I decided that I should keep the bigger share to myself. Others didn’t argue but seems like they have a different opinion."
256="I took the cooking process to my hands and offered to cook something special not the usual crap we fed others with. Didn’t go well and the meal wasn’t looking pretty either. Now I hope nobody’s going to notice the difference from the usual shit."
257="The guards didn’t lay their eyes off me so I wasn’t able to craft the shank I promised. Maybe someone tipped them off?"
258="I’ve snatched the bottle of bleach and hid it in my clothes. The screws didn’t even notice anything."
259="I need to have a drink goddamn it or I’ll smash someone’s head to bits instead."
260="I came to the common room to have a rest but there was only some shitty TV show that the others were eager to watch. More ads than show if you ask me. Anyway I was bored and didn’t rest that much."
261="I came to talk to one of the guards and reported to him about the murder. I couldn’t tell him the name of victim or in fact anything about. He just ignored but the others heard we talked and are thinking I’m a snitch now."
262="Showers were stuffed like a can of sardines and a bunch of inmates were standing in line. Instead of standing in line I just threw out of the shower the first loser that I got my hands on. He made a wise decision not to mess with me and scrammed. I took a nice hot shower but I didn’t like the look of guards when I was leaving. They didn’t interfere but they for sure didn’t approve what I’ve done."
263="Shit. I accidently messed one of guards uniform. I didn’t get paid for the shift but at least the screws didn’t beat the crap out of me."
264="I took some time watching others play ball and learned some new stuff. Doesn’t make me stronger but knowing some dirty tricks is always useful."
265="I decided to work like I always do without any experiments. I went straight to my cell after my shift was over."
266="I called my fellas about the contraband."
267="Turned out they didn’t really like my cooking. Everyone knew that I had a shift in the kitchen today and someone spread the word that it was my idea. I caught some really unpleasent looks out there. The picky fucks."
268="- Whatever. You know where to find me if you change your mind."
269="Working in the library is like having a vacation and I get paid for it. Just sort the books and answer dumb questions on where to find them. Much better than janitor and laundry work."
270="I’ve spend some time trying to cut the fence with the scissors but it turned out to be much harder than I expected. In the end I broke my scissors so it seemed like I wasn't getting any wire  that day for sure."
271="I’ve played ball with other cons the whole day. At the end of the day I was feeling tired like a dog but stronger than a bull."
272="I survived the fight. Someone is going to have to clean the blood from the walls."
273="Make a play"
274="One of the inmates gave me his desert when I finished my meal in the canteen. Respect can only be earned."
275="After my shift was over I went to the block and gifted the figurine to the local mob boss. He liked it and looks like I’ve broken the ice with him and his goons."
276="I wasn’t lucky enough this time and lost the game. I had to give the fucker my hard earned cigs. I managed to calm down and hold myself from ripping that dumb smile of his face."
277="I woke up in the infirmary. I still had a headache and I felt like got rammed by a truck. I’ve spent a couple of days there with our prison doc. He tried hard to make me tell him who had done this to me but I kept my mouth shut. I ain’t a snitch."
278="I returned to the camera and opened up the package. There were contraband scissors in it."
279="I’ve spent the whole day cooking for the other cons on my shift in the kitchen. Well at least I was able to snatch some food while working so I felt better in the end."
280="I’ve hid in my cell and was just about to get high when the guards found me. They searched me and sent me straight to the SHU. Nice day… Really nice."
281="I was able to snatch a bottle of whiskey."
282="It turned out that my idea wasn’t bad afterall. I was able to increase my norm for today’s shift. The screws were happy but the others looked at me like I was too much of a smartass."
283="I talked to one of the screws and told him about the murder. I couldn’t tell him the name of the victim or anything useful though. Well at least he knows me good enough to trust me so he promised to watch those thugs close. I’ve earned my respect with the guards."
284="- Oh stop bullshittin me, you greedy fuck. I know you have a shit load of cigs and if you don’t wanna help just say so , - he spit on the floor and went off. Looks like I’ve got myself a new enemy. Need to watch my back now."
285="I’ve decided to share the cigs evenly. They were glad to hear this and I’ve got their respect. Anyway I got my cut as well."
286="I got searched by the screws and they’ve found the stuff I was hiding. I’ve got a new trip to the solitary what can be better?"
287="Steal the Rat figurine"
288="I took the janitors shift today. Not the best and paid job but at least I’ve earned some cigs though."
289="I’ve spent my time working out. In the end I thought I could break chains now so I’ve added some more weight. Didn’t go well. I almost killed myself on the bench but got away with a small bruise. It’ll heal. No problem."
290="I’ve waited for the guard for a couple of hours but he didn’t return. The greedy bastard must have taken my cigs for himself."
291="Fetch a weapon"
292="I haven’t found anything useful but at least nobody saw me."
293="I tried to hide the knife in my clothes and sneak out with it. The screws stopped me right at the kitchen exit and searched me through. They’ve found the knife and I got beaten like never before. A trip to the SHU awaits!"
294="The prison got itself a new menu for today or so they said. I’ve waited eagerly in the line but I almost had my jaw drop when I saw the shit that they’ve given me. Others looked at with disgust as well. I’ve tried to eat at least something just to fight my hunger but I almost threw up."
295="Round up 350 cigs"
296="Shake someone down for cigs"
297="It took me almost half an hour to cut the wire but I did eventually. Good job but the scissors I had were broken to bits. I threw them away so nobody would see them ever again."
298="I decided that it’s too risky and just went with my shift as usual."
299="I returned to the camera and opened up the package. There was a bottle of whiskey in it. Great day!"
300="I decided to make a play and earn some cigs. I can beat some fools and take their cigs or go to Vegas and play some cards"
301="Other cons used me talking to the screws as a distraction and started a fight. The guards intervened but looks like they're thinking I did it intentionally. The cons are grateful however for the little diversion."
302="I hid in my cell and got high. I’ve spent a couple of hours on my bed and now things don’t seem so bad afterall."
303="I talked to one of the guards and told about the murder. I could even point out the victim. He promised me to investigate it and appreciated the help. Looks like I saved someones life today."
304="I snatched the soap and got away with it. Now I need to figure out why would I need it."
305="I went to the yard where nobody could see my and had a smoke. Luckily the screws haven’t noticed me."
306="I went out unnoticed to the yard and sterted walking along the fence. Some time later I noticed a package with some drugs in it. "
307="I called my mates, but didn't manage to get through. "
308="I decided to read something more educative and went to the science books shelf. I’ve spent hours trying to understand at least something but couldn’t even grasp the easiest stuff. I thought my mind was going to blow up so by the end of the day I had a painful headache."
309="I called my relatives and had a chat with them. It cheered me up."
310="- Thanks bro! I owe you one! - he smiled at me and went off. I’ll need to remind him about his debt in a couple of days."
311="I tried to snatch some soap from the showers but the guard caught me. I got a warning but at least they didn’t beat the crap out of me. Why are we not allowed to have our own soap anyway?"
312="Working at the prison kitchen means access to free food. I was able to snatch an extra meal for myself."
313="I decided to read something more educative and went to the science books shelf. I’ve spent hours reading them and actually was able to understand them. I ended up with a headache but at least I feel much smarter already. Seems I’m not that dumb afterall."
314="I was a freaking star today. I was so great at the game that a bunch of inmates gathered around the court to watch me play ball. I was tired as hell by the end of the match but I felt much fitter."
315="I went out unnoticed into the yard and started walking along the fence. Some time later I noticed a package. There was a dental floss in it."
316="I was stopped by a guard when I was going to watch some TV in the common room.\n - Hey, no TV for you today, inmate. Scram before I stick my foot in your ass!\n Seems I pissed off the guards too much. Sucks."
317="I went to the other block and found the guy that they wanted dead. I told him about their plan and seems like I earned his trust. I’ve earned my respect with him and others from his block."
318="I couldn't get through."
319="I was able to snatch a lighter and got away with it."
320="I tried to sneak past the guards with a bottle of bleach in my clothes but the scent gave me out. The screws took away the bleach and throwed me to the SHU. Nice try."
321="Watched the portable TV"
322="I had a bet with one of inmates that I could easily do a hundred push ups but I wasn't able to even do half of it. I had to give him my 5 cigs while others were laughing at me. I need to work out a bit more."
323="I accidently turned the bucket with dirty water on myself. Shit now I need to go to the shower to wash it out."
324="I proved my rights on this turf with brute force. I’ve beaten the crap out of the jerk and took his cigs. The rest of inmates paid up and I think they fear me now."
325="I returned to my cell and opened up the package. There were drugs in it. Great day!"
326="My victim had some cigs with him. I gladly took what was mine and left him on the floor. Others will know better now and will pay up when I ask."
327="Listened to the radio in the cell."
328="I was able to snatch a metal strip that someone left on the workbench unattended. The screws haven’t noticed anything and I was able to get away with it."
329="I decided to stay away of it and continued my walk in the yard."
330="I grabbed a large tome hoping that it would be at least interesting to read. Turned out to be quite a good one. I couldn’t finish it in one go so I took it to my cell to read it later."
331="After an energizing shower I got better. I even caught myself whistling some dumb song on my way back to my cell. I had a perfect mood. At least for now."
332="There wasn’t a lot of work today in the library so I grabbed a book and was reading it during the whole shift. Made me a bit smarter I think."
333="I went out unnoticed into the yard and started walking along the fence. Some time later I noticed a package. There was a lighter in it. "
334="I went out unnotice dinto the yard and started walking along the fence. Some time later I noticed a package. There was a duct tape in it."
335="I couldn't help smoking a couple of cigs more. Those were the last cigs in the pack so I tried to squeeze all I could out of them. Who knows when will be the next time I get my hands on some smokes?"
336="Snoop around the newcomer"
337="I decided to pay up instead of getting beaten. I don’t need any problems but maybe I should work out a bit?"
338="I’ve hid in my cell and got drunk. Luckily nobody have noticed me gone and I was even able to sober up and nap a bit."
339="I tried to talk to one of the screws but he was cold as ice. Told me to get lost before he beats me up. What’s his problem anyway?"
340="I played it like a pro and won 5 cigs. Nice."
341="I’ve made a club of the broken mop and was trying to hide it in my clothes when I noticed a guard behind my shoulder. He was standing there the whole time watching me. He took away my club and beat me with it."
342="I returned to my cell and opened up the package. There was a pack of cigs in it. Great day!"
343="An old friend of mine from the outside visited me here. We talked about recent business and other stuff. It's nice that I'm not totally forgotten."
344="- Then why’d you call for me you idiot? - the screw was angry as hell then turned around and walked away."
345="I told a joke about the prison guards and the screws were offended with it. They for sure didn’t like me making fools of them but other inmates laughed their asses out."
346="I forced the idiots to hand me over the remote and switched to my favorite channel. Nobody dared to say a word to me so we watched cartoons for a couple of hours."
347="Talk to"
348="An old friend of mine from the outside visited me here. We talked about recent business and other stuff. The news was nice, so I returned in great mood."
349="I tried to sneak past the guards with a pair of scissors in my pocket but they decided to search me. They’ve found the heat and now I’m on my way to the SHU."
350="I played with my muscles for a moment and offered him to solve our problems here and now. He paled and mumbled something about that there was no need for it. Others will now fear me."
351="I returned to the cell and opened up the package. There were wire cutters in it. Great day!"
352="I told others that we were gonna watch what I wanted and they agreed. It’s a good thing when other look up to you."
353="I was able to snatch some cigs."
354="Search for contraband stash"
355="I went out unnotice dinto the yard and started walking along the fence. Some time later I noticed a package. There were scissors in it."
356="I went out unnotice dinto the yard and started walking along the fence. Some time later I noticed a package. There was a magazine in it."
357="I decided to leave the uniform for myself and hid it in my own clothes. The screws haven’t noticed anything fishy when I went out of the laundry."
358="He kicked me in the face a couple of times more and then my “victim” checked my pockets. He took my cigs and went off to his cell. Shit."
359="I was able to snatch a magazine with some hot chicks. Nice."
360="- You’re gonna regret it fool, - he gave me a “terrifying“ look and then went off with his goons. Yeah, nice try jerk."
361="I got busted drinking whiskey in my cell. The screws searched me and then escorted me to the solitary."
362="Play cards"
363="Today my relatives came to me. I had a good time. It's always pleasant to get support from your close people."
364="I went out unnotice dinto the yard and started walking along the fence. Some time later I noticed a package. There were some cigs in it."
365="I felt like a pile of shit after a week in solitary. I’ve lost weight and I was so hungry I could eat a damn elephant. The screws escorted me to the yard and I just stood there like a vegetable. I need to put myself together fast."
366="I joined a group of inmates and tried to jump in the conversation they had. It didn’t go well. Nobody was even listening to me and I went off. The fucks hold me for a stray dog or something."
367="I talked to the guard and tried to tell him about the upcoming murder. I couldn’t give him a name or anything and he just ignored me. At least the other inmates haven’t noticed anything."
368="I called my friend and had a chat with them. It cheered me up."
369="I got my lawyer on the phone to discuss my case."
370="On my way out the gusrd stopped me. He found the contraband and threw me right into the SHU."
371="I called my relatives and agreed on the visit."
372="Get a crowbar or a staff key"
373="I accidently messed up the local mob boss with a bucket of dirty water I used while cleaning. Luckily there were a bunch of screws standing around so it didn’t escalate to a fight but he surely will remember me."
374="I went out unnotice dinto the yard and started walking along the fence. Some time later I noticed a package. There was a kitchen knife in it."
375="I was able to sneak past the screws with a pair of scissors in my pocket. They haven’t noticed anything so I got away with it."
376="- You’ll regret it once, when you need cigs for yourself, - he said to me with a grin on his face. Seems like he doesn’t like me now. Screw him I got my own problems."
377="Someone tried to trip me while I was carrying my meal to the table but luckily I could hold my balance. The jerks."
378="I was able to hide the knife in some rags and sneak past the guards. They haven’t searched me and I got away with it. Perfect."
379="I returned to my cell and opened up the package. There was a duct tape in it. Great day!"
380="I’m fucking tired and I feel like a piece of shit. I need to have a rest or even better have a nap."
381="I decided that it was too risky and refused. I could earn a lot of cigs but I don’t think it’s worth getting myself in the SHU."
382="Today everyone like the stuff we served at the canteen. Other inmates were very happy with food today. They don’t get fed like this often enough."
383="My relatives came to me. And such meetings are always a special pleasure. in the course of these fuckin' days in prison."
384="I offered him a cut of the cigs we collected. The thug made some thinking and eventually agreed to it. My goons just shrug their shoulders. We still had enough for everyone."
385="We’ve waited the whole evening for the screw to return but he didn’t. Seems like the greedy bastard just took the cigs for himself. Me and my buds were really pissed off."
386="After a couple of hours of playing cards with other thugs I decided I had enough for today. Just need to count my winnings."
387="I got busted smoking behind the storage building. The guard took my cigs for himself and searched me. At least he didn’t send me to the SHU."
388="I worked hard in the laundry today and overworked my shift norm. The guards were pleased of my work but other inmates looked at me like I was a suck up."
389="I've joined a group of inmates and jumped in their conversation. Rumours, politics, girls - even a small trash talk can make you feel better in this hole."
390="I found a comic book shelf in the library and spent hours reading them. Didn’t make me smarter but I did have my laughs."
391="A while later the guard brought a plastic bottle of beer. Tasted like a donkeys piss but me and my buds had our fun."
392="I played ball on the basketball court and was unlucky to hurt my knee. I’ve spent the rest of the game on the bench but still was able to learn a few dirty tricks. The knee still hurts though maybe I should visit our Doc in the infirmary."
393="I returned to my cell and opened up the package. There was a lighter in it. Great day!"
394="I returned to my cell and opened up the package. There was a magazine in it. Great day!"
395="The idiot realised that he was in a different weight league. He gave me all his cigs in front of everybody."
396="The showers were busy and a huge line of inmates stood in front of me. I took my place and started waiting for my turn when the screws showed up and told us that shower time was over. They send us back to our cells ignoring us bragging about it. Yeah.. now I’ll stink like shit for the rest of the day."
397="I tried to sneak past the guards with an extra uniform but they stopped me and searched my stuff. They found the uniform and took it away from me."
398="For Christ sake! I had a freaking roach in my meal! I’ve lost all my appetite."
399="I decided to have a rest in my cell and then it hit me that I’ve got a book from the library. I’ve spent a couple of hours looking for it but couldn’t find it anywhere. I’ve lost a good book and didn’t have a rest. Sucks."
400="They’ve shanked me a couple of times more and left me die in a pool of my own blood."
401="I found a nice spot in my cell where I can stash my contraband."
402="I returned to my cell and opened up the package. There was a dental floss in it. Great day!"
403="This damn habbit will kill me some day. I need to get a break and have a smoke or I'll lose my mind. I need a lighter and my cigs."
404="I got through and found out a piece of great news."
405="Looks like other inmates think I’m a snitch. I need to be careful cuz snitches get stitches. Maybe I should raise my reputation amongst other inmates."
406="TV broke down."
407="We had a new menu in the canteen today. All of the inmates were discussing it during meal time. I liked it and so did the others. I even tried to snatch an extra portion but was unlucky."
408="I was really unlucky today and lost the game. Well at least I didn’t bet any cigs on it."
409="A was able to make a club out of a mop and sneak it out of the storage room."
410="I haven't shot in so long, that I'm going through some major withdrawal right now. I sweat like a dog and feel like shit."
411="I got beaten up nastily."
412="I've been trying to find the package, which my buds had to throw over the fence, for two hours. But I didn't manage to find anything and got upset. Perhaps, they'll throw it tomorrow."
413="I played this game like a pool pro. I won the game and regretted that hadn’t bet any cigs on it."
414="One of the screws ordered me to follow him. He took me to a room with a couple of other screws and the security chief himself. As soon as I walked in they started beating the crap out of me with batons. When they were done with me a couple of bastards dragged me to the SHU. At least I didn’t have my ass raped."
415="I was snooping around in the cell looking for some stuff to steal and didn’t notice when the guy who lived here walked in. He kicked me in the face and threw me out of the cell. The screws saw this and I had to lie that I'd fallen. Now others think I’m a rat and my reputation is ruined."
416="I messed the metal sheets and the screws were really angry with me. My idea didn’t turn out well."
417="Radio broke down."
418="Someone tripped me up and I fell and dropped my food on the floor. Looks like I’m gonna be hungry for the rest of the day."
419="Come up with an escape plan"
420="I’ve spent hours trying to figure out how to escape from this wretched hole. The easiest way out seemed to tunnel out. I can’t dig from my cell but if I access the maintenance corridor and access the sewer system I think I can find a nice spot to dig there. I’ve flushed the papers I used for the plan just in case. Now I have an escape plan."
421="While I was working my shift one of the screws gave me a key and told to bring a crate with the tools to the storage room. Looks like the guards trust me enough to give the keys to the storage."
422="I entered the storage room and put the crate on the floor. I looked around and saw a whole bunch of interesting stuff lying around. If I snatch some of the tools nobody will notice."
423="Steal a screwdriver"
424="I took the screwdriver and was just about to look for something else when a guard walked in and rushed me. Well at least I’ve got something out of here."
425="I took the hammer and was just about to look for something else when a guard walked in and rushed me. Well at least I’ve got something out of here."
426="I made a club out of a mop and was just about to look for something else when a guard walked in and rushed me. Well at least I’ve got something out of here."
427="Steal a hammer"
428="Don’t touch anything"
429="A guard walked in just as I decided to leave everything as it is. I think I made the right choice. He could have seen me stealing tools so it’s all for the best."
430="I was able to find my way with the screws and they now let me rest in the staff room."
431="Go to the staff room"
432="The guards were distracted by my little diversion so I had time to make a cast of the key. I can also try to steal it but they will surely notice the loss."
433="Make a cast of the key"
434="I made a cast of the staff key."
435="Income and expenses of my gang"
436="I decided that it was too much of a risk. The guards were busy trying to calm everyone down so I was able to get back to my cell unnoticed."
437="Steal the staff key"
438="I stole the staff key but the guards will notice it very soon and will turn this place upside down looking for it. I need to store it somewhere where nobody is going to find it.."
439="I started making preparations for my escape."
440="Make a dummy-doll"
441="That’s enough for today"
442="I made a dummy out of some sheets and a pillow. Now I need to access the maintenance corridor behind the cell wall. The only way to get there is to unscrew the toilet. I’ll need a screwdriver to do this."
443="Unscrew the toilet"
444="I was able to get to the maintenance corridor. I’ve spent an hour wandering but I finally found the entrance to the sewer system. The door is locked tight so I need a staff key or a crowbar to unlock it. I’ll also need a flashlight if I don’t want to get lost."
445="Open the door"
446="I’ve opened the sewer door and looked for a nice place to dig a tunnel. I found a spot that as far as I understand nests right next to the outer wall. I’ll need a pickaxe to start digging the tunnel."
447="Dig the tunnel"
448="I’ve spent the whole night digging. I managed to make some progress but it’ll take a lot of days and effort to actually finish it. I returned to my cell and locked the sewer door. Seems like the screws haven’t noticed anything. Good."
449="I decided that I’ve had enough for today. I covered my tracks and returned to my cell."
450="I was able to steal a flashlight while the screws were busy handling the little diversion that I pulled off."
451="Steal a flashlight"
452="There is a chance to receive a crowbar after you seize control of the tools trade in the kitchen. You can also try to steal the staff key from the staff room but first you need to access it somehow."
453="I snatched the flashlight and hid it in my clothing and returned to my cell. The screws haven’t noticed anything."
454="Escape through the tunnel"
455="I escaped the prison through the tunnel."
456="Prepare an escape"
457="I have an opportunity to snatch a screwdriver while nobody is looking."
458="I’m too tired to work any further so I decided to get back to my cell. I need to rest for tomorrow."
459="The screws are going through a shakedown of all cells and prisoners. Seems like they know that someone has stolen a staff key."
460="The screws searched my cell and found my stash.\n - You’re going to the SHU, lad, - the guards told me."
461="The screws searched my cell but weren’t able to find any contraband. Idiots."
462="Me and my buds went to shakedown the fools in our block. We were able to get a nice wad of cigs of them."

I'm gonna need a screwdriver, a flashlight and a staff key. I can easily get a screwdriver, but I'll need [green] to go to work [/green] to the workshop and get it out of there or [green] to go to the haggler [/green] he definitely has it. The only way to get a torch and a key is to get on with the screws. Then I'll be able to [green] get into the staff room [/green] and carefully snatch both the flashlight and the key."

517="Get a screwdriver"
518="To access maintenance corridor I need to unscrew the toilet. I’ll need a screwdriver for that and I can get it from the workshop."
519="Get a flashlight"
520="It’ll be dark in the sewers and I’ll need a flashlight if I don’t want to get lost there. I can get it from the staffroom."

528="FREEEEEEEDOM! Just have to wait till the night comes."
529="”Proven guilty”. The next morning after the trial I was cuffed and escorted to the prison bus. They took my stuff when we arrived and had me go through some dumb paperwork. After that they took me to a room where they’ve checked every damn hole in my body looking for any contraband that I might have. One of the guards with an attitude ordered me to follow him."
530="I’ve spent the rest of the night digging like a mole. I did a good job and was able to dig a nice tunnel but I broke my tools. I’ll need to make a new pickaxe if I want to dig any further. I covered my tracks and got back to my cell. Seems like the screws haven’t noticed anything."
531="I’ve spent the rest of the night digging like a mole. I got real tired and I think I sprained a muscle. I covered my tracks and got back to my cell. Seems like the screws haven’t noticed anything."
532="I started digging when a cave-in happened. I got buried a bit and had to dig my way out. Part of the tunnel collapsed so I’ll have to start over again. I got to my cell in the morning before the roll call. Seems like the screws haven’t noticed anything."
533="I’ve spent the rest of the night digging like a mole. I was able to expand the tunnel further than I expected and dug a real long way through. I covered my tracks and got back to my cell. Seems like the screws haven’t noticed anything."
534="I’ve spent the rest of the night digging like a mole. I had to dig through the foundation of one of the buildings so it was kind of noisy. I covered my tracks and got back to my cell. Seems like the screws heard the noise when I was digging. I’ll need to lay low for a while."
535="I stumbled upon gas pipe that goes under the foundation of one of the buildings. If I dig any further I might damage the pipe and will get blown to pieces. I can try to dig around but that will take some time."
536="Dig around the pipe"
537="I decided that it would be better if I dig around the pipe avoiding the risk of blowing myself up. It will take more time to dig the tunnel but I’ll be in one piece. I got to my cell in the morning before the roll call. Seems like the screws haven’t noticed anything."
538="Dig under the pipe"
539="I decided to dig under the pipe to save the precious time. I had to work really carefully to avoid hitting the pipe but it worked out just fine. I hope I won’t hit my head when I get back though."
540="I decided to dig under the pipe to save the precious time. I started digging and then..."
541="I was digging my tunnel when I saw water flooding it. Maybe it’s just some underground streams but I better check it out. If the sewer pipe collapses the tunnel will be flooded for sure."
542="Look for the leak"
543="I decided to check things and started looking for the possible leak. It took some time but I finally found the problem. It appeared that one of the sewer pipes had got damaged. I fixed it with a rag and the leak stopped."
544="I decided to check things and started looking for the possible leak. I’ve spent the whole night but couldn’t find the problem. The water level in the tunnel was lower by morning so I was lucky but I didn’t make any progress on the tunnel."
545="I decided to check things and started looking for the possible leak. I’ve spent the whole night but couldn’t find the problem. The water level in the tunnel raised by the morning and part of the tunnel collapsed. I barely survived it and now I’ll have to start over again."
546="Continue digging"
547="I decided that digging the tunnel is more important than dealing with this flooding problem. It could be nothing after all. The water level in the tunnel was lower by morning so I was lucky and I was able to further up my progress."
548="I decided that digging the tunnel is more important than dealing with this flooding problem. It could be nothing after all. The water level in the tunnel raised by morning and part of the tunnel collapsed. I barely survived it and now I’ll have to start over again."
549="I started digging the tunnel but after a while I felt that I was too exhausted. I need to decide if it’s worth forcing myself to work any further or I better go back and have a rest and continue tomorrow."
550="Dig further"
551="I decided to force myself to dig. I felt like I’m gonna die there but I continued my work through sheer will. I could barely crawl my way back to my cell before the morning roll call. Seems like the guards haven’t noticed anything."
552="The screws started a shakedown in the morning. I guess they’re suspecting that someone is digging out of here."
553="I made my way to the sewers and started looking for my digging spot. I then realised that I got lost in that damn corridor labyrinth. I decided to make my way back to the cell before I get lost for good and wouldn’t be able to get back in time."
554="I made my way to the sewers and started looking for my digging spot. I burned my arm passing one of the hot water pipes and dropped my flashlight. It broke and I couldn’t fix it. I decided to get back to my cell before I got lost here without any light."
555="There was a fire in the canteen today. After the fire got dealt with the warden gathered us up and told us that the canteen is closed and our meals will be delivered to our cells. Until they fix the canteen nobody will be able to eat properly it seems."
556="The workers finished rebuilding the canteen after the fire. Finally I’ll be able to eat like a man!"
557="Talk to the security chief"
558="Snoop around the newcomer"
559="Search for contraband stash"
560="I decided to snoop around the newcomer. I can ask the others if know anything or talk to him in person."
561="Talk to others"
562="I decided that it would be better if I don’t engage him directly. I hanged around the block and asked if anyone knew the guy. I was able to find a couple of his old friends. They told me everything they knew without asking any questions. I managed to pull a nice profile on him. Now I need to report to the chief."
563="I decided that it would be better if I don’t engage him directly. I hanged around the block and asked if anyone knew the guy. I haven’t found anyone and I fear that others think that I’m asking too many questions. They might suspect me sniffing out on him for the screws."
564="Interrogate the newcomer"
565="I decided that I should talk to him in person. I found him in the yard and told him that we have a matter to discuss. I brought him to a quiet place with nobody around where we could talk in private."
566="I decided to search for contraband stashes like I was told by the chief. I suspect they might be either in the kitchen, library, laundry or the common room. I need to decide which one should I search first."
567="Beat the crap out of him and then ask questions"
568="I beat the crap out of him and as soon as he caught his breath I started to ask questions. He was so terrified that told me everything about himself straight away. Now we’re talking. I’ve sent the poor bastard crawling to his cell. I need to talk to the boss now."
569="Turned out he wasn’t that weak after all. He knocked me off easily. I managed to catch my breath a moment later but he had already been gone. I went back to my cell angry and disappointed."
570="Earn his trust"
571="I decided to earn his trust first and get to know him better. He’s not the most trustworthy person in the world but nobody can stand against my charm. A couple of hours later he thought of me as his best buddy and let his hair down on me. I know everything I need now. Gotta talk to the boss."
572="I decided to earn his trust first and get to know him better. He’s not the most trustworthy person in the world and I’m not Mister Charisma. I couldn’t get anything from him. Now he’s gonna talk and tell everyone that I’m asking too many questions."
573="Search in the library"
574="I’ve spent a couple of hours and turned the library upside down. In the end I was able to find a small stash behind a panel on the ceiling. I decided to keep things as they were. If I steal anything it will alert the owner. I need to talk to the boss now."
575="I’ve wasted a couple of hours and turned the library upside down but couldn’t find anything. Other inmates looked at me with suspicion. I think they know I’m not just here for books."
576="I’ve wasted a couple of hours and turned the library upside down but couldn’t find anything. At least there weren’t a lot of people there and nobody noticed me poking around."
577="I was searching the room for the stash when one of the inmates jumped on me unexpectedly. By look on his face it seems that it’s his stash I’m looking for.\n - The fuck you’re looking here, asshole? Trouble? Get lost before I break your legs and shove them in your ass!"
578="Search in the kitchen"
579="Leave"
580="I decided to keep it civil and left before I got into any trouble with him. I think it’s the right spot to look for but I need to do it when this shmuck isn’t around. I got to my cell but noticed some weird looks thrown at me. The guy must have told everyone that I’m snooping around."
581="I stopped bashing his head on the floor and dragged him to the wall. I interrogated him and had to convince him to tell me everything with some additional head banging. He told me where his stash is and I pretended that I wanted it for myself. I let him go and checked the stash to see if it was really there. Now I need to talk to the boss."
582="He knocked me out and I’ve spent like ten minutes on the floor. I crawled my way back to the cell and then someone told me that the guy was spreading rumours about me. Shit."
583="Search in the laundry"
584="I’ve spent a couple of hours and turned the laundry upside down. In the end I was able to find a small stash behind a panel on the ceiling. I decided to keep things as they were. If I steal anything it will alert the owner. I need to talk to the boss now."
585="I’ve wasted a couple of hours and turned the laundry upside down but couldn’t find anything. Other inmates looked at me with suspicion. I think they know I’m not just here for dirty clothes."
586="I’ve wasted a couple of hours and turned the laundry upside down but couldn’t find anything. At least nobody noticed me poking around."
587="I’ve spent a couple of hours and turned the kitchen upside down. In the end I was able to find a small stash behind the fridge. I decided to keep things as they were. If I steal anything it will alert the owner. I need to talk to the boss now."
588="I’ve wasted a couple of hours and turned the kitchen upside down but couldn’t find anything. Other inmates looked at me with suspicion. I think they know I’m not just here for an extra meal."
589="I’ve wasted a couple of hours and turned the kitchen upside down but couldn’t find anything. At least nobody noticed me poking around."
590="Search in the common room"
591="I’ve spent a couple of hours and turned the common room upside down. In the end I was able to find a small stash behind the TV panel. I decided to keep things as they were. If I steal anything it will alert the owner. I need to talk to the boss now."
592="I’ve wasted a couple of hours and turned the common room upside down but couldn’t find anything. Other inmates looked at me with suspicion. I think they know I’m snooping around for something.."
593="I’ve wasted a couple of hours and turned the common room upside down but couldn’t find anything. At least nobody noticed me poking around."
594="The TV in the common room was broken and the inmates started making waves. The guards have sent for a technician but seems the guy can’t sober up and doesn’t know what the problem is. I can try to calm everyone down or try to fix the TV on my own. Otherwise things can get real messy."
595="Try to fix the TV"
596="I quickly got what the problem was and me and the tech guy fixed it in no time. The inmates calmed down and appreciated my help. I was able to watch my favorite TV show and have good rest afterwards."
597="I couldn’t get what the problem was either. The inmates settled down and went to mind other stuff around but I’ve spent hours trying to fix the TV and didn’t rest much like I wanted."
598="Come up with something else"
599="I started making jokes about the screws and the tech idiot out there while they were attempting to fix the TV. Others liked it and had their laughs so the heat went off. We went to the yard later when everyone was done rolling on the floor laughing."
600="I tried to make some jokes about the screws and tell some stories but it just didn’t work out well. Well at least everyone just got tired from sitting around and went to do some other stuff."
601="I decided to just wait for them to fix the goddamn TV. They’ve spent hours trying to figure out the problem but failed eventually. I’ve missed my favorite TV show because of these idiots but at least it didn’t escalate to an open riot."
602="The others got real angry because of this shit. Someone threw an empty pack of chips at the screws and then someone started a fight. Moments later an open riot started and I was dragged into a fight."
603="I was kind of fine and still standing on my feet when the screws busted into the room. They made their way with batons and settled down our small riot. They dragged everyone who was involved to the SHU."
604="I got beaten badly when the screws busted into the room. They made their way with batons and settled down our small riot. They dragged everyone who was involved to the SHU."
605="We were playing ball when an argument broke out all of a sudden between our guy and an idiot from the other team. I need to do something or it can quickly escalate into a fight."
606="Try to solve the matter"
607="I tried to calm both off them down and talk it through. I’m good at talking so we were able to quickly settle the matter and continued the game. I think I earned my rep for this peacekeeping duty."
608="I tried to calm both off them down and talk it through. I got pushed away and the fight was about to start when the screws showed up. They ordered us to leave the court so nobody got hurt but we weren’t able to finish the game."
609="Pacify the idiots"
610="I walked right between them and banged them with their heads. This actually had the right effect on both of them and I was able to settle the matter between them. After that we finished the game as usual."
611="Ambush the insulter"
612="I decided that it wasn't my problem and that it was just between them. Anyway it solved itself when the screws showed up so there was no fight. We couldn’t finish the game though."
613="I tried to calm both of them down, but didn't cope with it. A serious fight started."
614="I walked right between them and banged them with their heads. This gave the wrong effect that I wanted and it quickly escalated into a fight between the two teams."
615="I decided that it wasn't my problem and that it was just between them. They continued to argue until one of them lost his nerve and hit the other idiot with his head. It quickly escalated into a fight between our two teams."
616="I was able to stay on my feet the whole fight but then the screws rushed in. I found myself on the ground with my face in the mud. Everyone who was involved in the fight got a trip to the SHU. Including me."
617="I got beaten like a kitten and was lying on the ground when the court was overrun by the guards. Everyone who was involved in the fight got a trip to the SHU. Including me."
618="I was hanging around the prison doing nothing when one of the inmates asked me for help. Looks like his radio is broken and he wants to know if I know anything about electronics."
619="Take a look at the radio"
620="I told him that I actually had a knack in it and took the radio to have a look at it. Looks like a wire has burned out but I’ll need a duct tape to fix it. I can also try to open the radio with a screwdriver and see if I can fix it from the inside."
621="Try to fix it without the tools"
622="I decided to do it the other way and just pinched the wire. The music started playing and the fellow was very happy about it. He was grateful for the help and told his friends about me helping him."
623="Fix the wire with the duct tape"
624="I twisted round the wire with the duct tape and it worked fine. The guy was grateful and gave some cigs for the trouble. He told me that he would pass the word to the right people for me."
625="Fix the radio from the inside"
626="I was able to open the radio up with the screwdriver I had with me and fixed the problem from the inside. The guy was grateful and gave some cigs for the trouble. He told me that he would pass the word to the right people for me."
627="I can’t help"
628="I had a look on the radio and found the problem but I couldn’t fix it. I’ve some time trying to do something but then told him that I couldn't help. He was pretty angry with me. I went off to mind some other stuff but I think the guy will now hold a grudge on me."
629="I had a look on the radio but couldn’t figure out what the problem was and told him that I can’t help. He was pretty angry at me. I went off to mind some other stuff but I think the guy will now hold a grudge on me."
630="I told him that I was lame in this electronic bullshit and went off to mind some other stuff. The fella shrug his shoulders and continued poking in the radio on his own."
631="I was hanging around the prison doing nothing when a guard hailed me and ordered me to go and clean the prison yard with the other inmates."
632="Convince the guard to make someone else do it"
633="I pretended to be ill and tired and the the guard got off my back. He found some other loser for the work. I got away with it but I think the other inmates won’t approve this."
634="Break the door with the crowbar"
635="I agreed to help clean up the yard and he gave me a garbage bag. I went straight to the yard and found a couple of other losers already working there. Someone clearly said: “I’m fucking done with this shit. Let them do clean the shit on their own. Assholes”."
636="Organize the work"
637="I decided to try and organize these lazy idiots. I’m good at talking so I was able to convince them working as a team. We managed to clean up much faster and didn’t even break a sweat. The guards for sure liked it."
638="I decided to try and organize these lazy bastards but talking isn’t my best feature. Nobody was even listening to me and actually thought that I was doing this to please the guards."
639="Do all the hard work"
640="I told everyone that I'd take all the hard work. I can’t avoid this shit but at least I can try to make myself a bit stronger. I felt real tired in the end but my muscles are growing. The guards noticed my effort as well."
641="I told everyone that I’d take all the hard work. I can’t avoid this shit but at least I can try to make myself a bit stronger. I felt real tired in the end and seems I sprained my back. The screws were happy but I think it wasn’t worth it."
642="Work like the rest"
643="I decided that there’s no need to show off and worked like the rest slowly collecting the garbage. It seemed easy enough but still I got real tired by the end. We finished the clean up and the screws let us do our stuff."
644="I was too tired but couldn’t avoid the work. I had to force myself to work because the screws were watching closely and used their baton on those who as they thought worked slowly. I felt like a slave and was barely alive when I got back to my cell."
645="Play"
646="I wasn’t even able to finish when my teeth had to say “hello” to mister baton. The screw couldn’t make me work but he surely had the opportunity to beat the hell out of me with his baton. At least he didn’t throw me into the SHU. Now I’ll have more problems with guards. Nobody dares to refuse them."
647="I was hanging around doing nothing when one of the inmates hailed me and asked to help him write an appeal."
648="Help him"
649="I decided that I could spare some time and help the poor guy so we settled down with a pen and paper in hand. I can write an appeal in two ways: either the more formal one by the book or try to put some more emotions in it pushing the right buttons."
650="Write a formal appeal"
651="A formal appeal by the book is better in my opinion. It wasn’t easy to do it right but I recalled some stuff I read in some law books and managed to pull it off. I’ve handed it to the guards but they just shrug their shoulders. There was nothing to pick at and the other inmates liked it."
652="A formal appeal by the book is better in my opinion. I think I did a couple of mistakes and didn’t do it properly overall. The guards laughed like idiots when they were reading the stuff and made fun out of the inmate who asked me for help. The fella was real mad at me."
653="Write an emotional appeal"
654="I decided to write an appeal that would make the parole officer cry. It looked great. I quoted some parts to the other inmates and they really liked it. The guy was really grateful."
655="I decided to write an appeal that would make the parole officer cry. Maybe I’m not the best writer in the world but at least I tried to do my best. Others were bursting with laughter when I quoted some parts. This didn’t bring any respect to me and the guy looks kinda angry at me."
656="I told him that I’m not that good at writing and went off minding my own business."
657="I noticed a bunch of inmates training in the yard. A tough guy was showing them some moves. Maybe I should join them? Being able to defend yourself or beat the crap out of someone is always useful."
658="Join them"
659="I asked to teach me some new moves. I’ve spent a couple of hours trading blows with them and I've learn a few new tricks. I missed a few hooks in the head but still felt better than before."
660="I asked to teach me some new moves. I’ve spent a couple of hours trading blows with them and I've learn a few new tricks but there’s no holding off in these kind of training so I missed a couple of hard blows in the head and wasn’t feeling so good in the end."
661="I asked to teach me some new moves but they just laughed at me.\n - Get lost before we make you our training dummy.\n I decided to get back to my cell to avoid any problems."
662="Do something else"
663="I decided to mind other stuff and continued hanging around the prison."
664="Someone told me that there was a fool spreading rumours about me. I need to get him back in line. Show him his place around here."
665="Find him and teach him a lesson"
666="I was looking for him all around the prison. I finally was able to find the idiot in one of the blocks. The fucker was just about to tell another story about me. I got mad and just jumped on him."
667="I punched him a couple of times more and looked around. A bunch of inmates watched our fight.\n - Anyone else wants to shit me?\n Nobody was willing and a moment later the guards showed up and cuffed me. I’m gonna go to the SHU but I doubt anyone will talk shit about me anytime soon. They’ve learned their lesson."
668="He turned out to be much stronger than me and knocked me out. A bunch of screws showed up and dragged us both to the SHU. Well at least I’ve tried to stand up for myself."
669="Ambush him in a quiet place"
670="I better deal with him in a more subtle fashion so that the guards won’t see anything. I pretended that I didn’t give a damn about it and the other inmates thought that I was just a weakling. They’ll change their mind soon."
671="I decided that I didn’t need any more trouble so I let it slide. Other inmates just thought that I was a weakling and couldn’t stand up for myself. Well at least I haven’t got beaten as usual."
672="I decide to wait for him in one of the empty corridors that lead to our block. There’s usually nobody around but the bastards likes to take this route for some reason. I saw him coming and prepared to jump on him."
673="I’ve beaten the hell out of him and left a few broken bones to remind him about me. Then I stuck a piece of paper on his head and wrote “Lesson learned”. Now others will have more respect of me."
674="It didn’t go as I expected. I was on the floor in a pool of my own blood. He punched me a couple of times and left. My buds found me later on and dragged me back to my cell."
675="We played ball at the court and my team started losing like we were a bunch of monkeys. Maybe I should take lead and motivate them? Or maybe I should just show them how it should be played on my own?"
676="Motivate them"
677="I took lead and started ordering them around. I’m not that bad at basketball and people tend to listen to me so they silently agreed to my leadership. We were able to win the match and others were grateful."
678="I took the lead and started yelling at them giving orders. Nobody was listening to me and someone even told to shut the fuck up. We lost the game and others were angry with me like it was my fault. Idiots."
679="Show off and play on my own"
680="- That’s how it’s done suckers! - I took the ball of one of my teammates and played it on my own. I’m a tough fella and a good player so I managed to even the score pretty fast. Eventually we’ve won the match. I was tired of course but the lads from my team were happy for sure."
681="- That’s how it’s done suckers! - I took the ball of one of my teammates and played it on my own. I’m a tough fella and a good player so I managed to even the score pretty fast. The other team quickly understood who was the most valuable player here and played it rough against me. Eventually we’ve won the match but they’ve played a few dirty tricks against me. I was tired and my knee hurt but the lads from my team were happy for sure."
682="- That’s how it’s done suckers! - I took the ball of one of my teammates and played it on my own. I’m actually not that good at this game so I just fucked up everything. My teammates were freaking mad at me and we lost the match."
683="Who cares if we win or not? I just continued to play like I always do. We lost the game but it for sure wasn’t my fault. I still had a bad taste of it but at least I had a good exercise."
684="I was working out when a shady looking inmates came to my bench.\n - Yo! Listen, I just got these cool roids, you want any? They’re kinda overdue a bit, shitty stuff but if it works you’ll be pumped like a bull! What do you say? 50 cigs that’s all I want!"
685="Buy the steroids"
686="I decided to try them out and bought the stuff. They tasted like shit but I got pumped like a bison. I could workout with weights twice my own and in the end I felt like bison myself. I need to take a rest though… Something wrong with my head… Hard to concentrate… Need to lay for a while."
687="Description:"
688="I decided that I didn’t need any shady shit to workout so I just continued with my exercise. Better to stay alive."
689="I won the game but my opponent jumped up and started yelling at me saying that I cheated. I tried to calm down the idiot telling him that you couldn’t cheat in chess but he just wasn’t able to calm down. Looks like there’s gonna be some trouble soon..."
690="Try to calm him down"
691="I was really confident in my words and also I have a knack at talking to idiots like him. It turned out fine and the guy calmed before the guards showed up. Looks like I get better at talking."
692="Intimidate him"
693="I told him that I'd skin him alive if he wouidn’t calm down. The truth was on my side and the idiot finally realised it. He conceded his defeat and went off. I feel like I’m much better at making things work the way I want."
694="I tried to deal with him peacefully but the fucker just didn’t want to calm down. He flipped the table and jumped on me swinging his fists like a mad ape."
695="I told him that I’d smash his skull if he wouldn’t calm down but that only made him more mad at me. He flipped the table and jumped on me swinging his fists like a mad ape."
696="I was able to fend him off but the screws were right on top of us already. We both got dragged to the SHU and the guards didn’t even want to listen to anything."
697="The bastard caught me off guard and punched me a few time before the guards showed up. We both got dragged to the SHU and the guards didn’t even want to listen to anything."

707="GOAL"
708="--no goal--"
709="The screws decided to do a shakedown all of a sudden."
710="Seems like the warden was charged by some human rights activists and he had to hire some new guards. They are much friendlier and don’t know shit about this prison. It will be much easier to earn their trust for my own needs."
711="The new screws now know a thing about us here so it won’t be easy to get along with them anymore."
712="The prison is having some financial issues and that idiot warden decided to lower the amount of prison labor. I’m left with no job now like I did on the outside."
713="The prison gained some new funding and the financial issues are done with. Maybe I can get my old job back."
714="Go to the storage"
715="I came to the staffroom. I can have a rest here without anyone bothering me or try to snatch something."
716="I had a rest in the staffroom."
717="I decided to try and steal a flashlight from the staffroom."
718="Fast-talk the guard with the flashlight"
719="I was able to distract the guard with some trash talk and steal his flashlight. He didn't notice anything and I got away with it."
720="I tried to distract the guard with some trash talk but couldn’t catch him off guard. I wasn’t able to steal the flashlight."
721="It took some time to distract the guard with some trash talking and when I thought that nobody was looking I tried to grab his flashlight. One of the screws saw it and searched me. He found the flashlight and took it away from me. I got escorted back to the pen afterwards."
722="Make a diversion"
723="I decided that it would be easier to steal anything if the guards were distracted by something. I now need to think of a diversion."

We’re square now?\nI took the cigs and went back to my cell. It’s good that I didn’t have to mess him up."
878="I looked at him and realised that if I kept pushing him I'd end up in the infirmary. I dicided to let it slide this time. Better to be in one piece than have a couple of more bucks.

1003="Where am I?"

1005="How long have I been here?"
1006="Did you see how I was brought here?"
1007="Carlos went on glaring at me. Probably he didn't like me asking so many questions, but I was so exhausted I didn't feel like being polite at all.

Then I met Sarah and my life changed. I quit the game. I'd been living a normal life for 3 years, everything seemed perfect. But once Sarah went to the grocery store and never came back."
1011="Soon I realized she was kidnapped by the local Mob. It doesn't take a genius to figure out they wanted something from me. Of course they did. I was told there was a task for the best thief in the state, Eddie Boyd, that I had to take care of it in a prison. And Sarah's life depends if I can do it or not. I had to take the blame for a crime I had not commited to get into this place."
1012="Sit on the bunk"
1013="Come up to the cell door"
1014="I noticed the Big Homie looking steadily at my arm. "What's that?" - Carlos asked. I took a look at my sleeve. It was covered with blood."
1015="Roll up the sleeve"
1016="Come closer to the mirror shard on the wall"
1017="A tattoo on my arm! It was fresh: the blood flowed from it. My wife's kidnappers left 11 digits of the phone number on my arm as a reminder. And suddenly I remembered I had to call this number as soon as possible, so that Harry, the local drug dealer could tell me exactly what to do. I can waste time no more!"
1018="Ask the neighbor about the phonebooth"
1019="“Sure, we have a telephone. It's downstairs, next to the medical center. If you need a telephone card, I can sell it to you. You see, you gotta pay if you wanna get in touch with someone on the outside""

1021="Thanks, I’ll deal with it on my own"
1022="I searched in my footlocker and found two packs of cigarettes there. That was enough to pay Carlos for the phone card. I thanked him and went out to find the phone."
1023="I decided to snoop around the place and call Harry afterwards. I thanked Carlos and went off."
1024="Search for the phonebooth"
1025="As I left the cell, it soon became clear to me if there was hell, I was already there. One could easily go crazy because of the continuous blinking of light bulbs. An army of black roaches swarmed all over the walls. A scary face of one of the cons appeared behind the bars of one of the upper cells. "Ahh, fresh meet arrived" he said. I tried to quicken my pace. Where do I go next?"
1026="Go left to the elevators"
1027="Go right to the elevators"
1028="The corridor reminded me of those horror movies about asylums. Peeling walls, swear words, screaming and noise enough to drive you nuts all over the place. This place is freaking depressing."
1029="I turned around the corner and heard one of the inmates whistling. That was a sign. Pieces of trash and cigarette stubs were thrown at me from above. I figured it was the inmates' special way to tell me "Welcome, bro.""
1030="I kept walking, my gaze dropped. The darkness grew deeper, the cons' screaming and shouting grew louder. "Damn, where are those elevators" I thought. I took a few steps forward and found myself in front of the elevator doors. I gotta get out of here!"
1031="Call the elevator"
1032="It seemed like the waiting lasted for an eternity. At last the door opened and I saw two big guys standing in front of me in the elevator. They held a body bag with a living creature inside. Someone in the bag squirmed and moaned. One of the big guys said "You comin' or what? We're going upstairs""
1033="Thanks, I’m goin down"
1034="Enter the elevator"
1035="The moment I entered the elevator one of the big guys grabbed me by the throat, another one searched my pockets and found nothing. Then he pushed me out of the elevator and shouted "See ya, sucker!""
1036="While heavy elevator doors were closing I saw one of the big guys punching the body bag. Someone in the bag screamed."
1037="Call the elevator again"
1038="This time another elevator came. The doors opened and I was relieved to see it was empty. I stepped in and the door closed. There was a shiv with stains of blood on it on the floor. I bent down and picked it up. The next moment the light went out."
1039="Search for the buttons in the dark"
1040="Bang on the door"
1041="Suddenly I heard the tramp of feet. The door was opened from the outside with a crowbar. It was the warden. He looked with astonishment at my hand with the bloody shiv and by surprise, dropped the crowbar. The doors slammed shut. I was lucky twice, because he couldn’t see my face in the dark. "
1042="Sit quietly"
1043="All of a sudden someone shouted "They killed him with a shiv. Right into his chest! The murderer is in the elevator right now!""
1044="Gasping, I groped for elevator buttons. Some of them were torn away. Which of those buttons will get me to the ground floor?"
1045="Press the last button"
1046="Press the second-to-last button"
1047="Press the button in the middle"
1048="The light was back. The elevator jerked and went down clanking. When it stopped and the doors opened, I peeped out. At that moment I thought I'd die of fear right there. But the floor was quiet. "
1049="Go out of the elevator"
1050="Go back to the cell"
1051="Shit! The elevator jerked once more and stopped dead. The light went out. "
1052="Go to a random floor"
1053="I pressed the nearest button, but nothing happened. The elevator didn't move an inch. That reminded of a scary movie about the lift-killer. "
1054="Somehow I got out of the elevator and walked to the right, where the corridor was lit with light. There was medical centre to the left, and through the open door I saw a nurse covering a body with an angel tattoo on his shoulder with a white sheet . Need to get used to it, coz in this place people croak like this every day."
1055="Finally I saw a payphone. Here it is! Hurry, let's call Harry. But where is my phone card?"
1056="Call up Harry"
1057="Not now"
1058="There were two other convicts waiting to make a call. The last one for about half an hour was chatting with his mama describing all hardships of living in prison. Hearing all that whining made me sick, but finally he hung up. Barely holding back the excitement, I walked over to the phone."
1059="Look at the number on my arm. "
1060="I rolled up prison robe sleeve and looked at the phone number. That's a pretty fine method to make me remember the number. Assholes! "
1061="Turn a dial"
1062="Harry didn't respond. I started giving up to despair, when suddenly he answered the call."
1063="Hi, it's Eddie"
1064="Harry?"
1065=""What's up, mate. It took hella lot of time. Did ya want to slip off?""
1066="No, no, I'm in. "
1067="Let me talk to Sarah. "
1068=""Your wife is safe and sound. If you do everything I tell you, both of you will live happily ever after, and give birth to many children. Hopefully, they will not inherit your bad luck, ragamuffin. ""
1069="What do you want? "
1070="Why I should trust you? "
1071="Can you swear it?"
1072=""Don't waste time. Listen and remember. You should find 3 netsuke in prison.""
1073="Is it some japanese comic book for adults?"
1074="Is it a new drug?"
1075="Is it some word for gun? "
1076=""Are you dumb? Netsuke - are miniature sculptures, carved from bone. I'm sure they are somewhere in prison. All I know, that Dragon netsuke was taken from a convict by force. You should find all three figurines. ""
1077="Is this all about figurines?"
1078="You're going to kill Sarah because of lousy figurines? "
1079="You won't get away with it."
1080=""Easy, bro. You're at my mercy. First of all, find netsuke owners and prove if it's true, that Eddie Boyd is the best thief in the city." I heard short dial tones and hung up. Seems I have no choice. I'm back to business."
1081="Search for Cat netsuke"
1082="In prison, like in life, the cat is out of the bag, always. It's hard to keep a secret. If I want to know netsuke whereabouts, I have to [green] talk to convicts [/green], [green] hang around the jail [/green] and keep my ears cocked. "
1083="While I was lounging about the basketball ground, I heard a convict telling about a man named Fang, who works in the canteen. I pricked up my ears and came closer, just in case. As it turned out, on Friday night Fang won at cards an expensive statuette of a cat. Seems like it's exactly what I'm looking for!"
1084="Go to the canteen"
1085="I decided to go to the canteen and ask inmates about Fang. Breakfast had just ended, there were few people in the canteen. I need to figure out what Fang looks like and check whether he has the netsuke, I'm looking for."
1086="Ask convicts in the canteen"
1087="Peer at the convicts"
1088="I saw a dejected fatso. That's an ideal candidate for questioning. I can try to ask him about Fang."
1089="Start speaking politely"
1090="The fatso said he was a newcomer and still didn't know anybody. And suggested asking the thug, sitting in a corner of the canteen."
1091="Intimidate him with a fork"
1092="I quietly approached fatso. When guards were looking the other way, I pressed him against the wall and threatened with a fork, making my voice sound menacingly, I said:"
1093="Who is Fang?"
1094="What do you know about the Cat netsuke?"
1095="Fatso started mumbling, so I realized he knew nothing. Poor fellow. "
1096="The fatso was paralyzed with fright. His hands were shaking. He was about to burst into tears. At this point, I felt wretched of my behavior. But I can't disdain any methods, because the life of my wife is at stake."
1097="Push harder"
1098="The fatso started to beg me not to kill him. From the look in his eye I'd say, he is about to tell me everything."
1099="Put the fork away and listen"
1100="In a quavery voice fatso whispered: "Fang is a nickname of Zach, the chef in the kitchen. You'll know him by the lion's claw on his neck. ""
1101="Give Fatso 5 cigs"
1102="Give Fatso 10 cigs"
1103="Say 'thanks' and tap him on the shoulder"
1104="I gave Fatso cigs and tapped him on the shoulder. Well, now I know who's Fang! I saw the lion's claw on Zach's neck before, but simply didn't think about it. Now, I must find other two figurines, Dragon and Rat."
1105="Well, now I know who is Fang! Thanks, fatso, you may go now. I need to figure out who possesses the other two figurines."
1106="Use a trick"
1107="I realized I could apply the tactics of "Beating not to be beaten." The idea is to go to the canteen and throw down a challenge to Fang. As you know, the challenge in prison is a serious matter. If Fang doesn't respond, inmates will consider him a chode. I need a cockroach to carry out all nicely."
1108="I need to catch a cockroach"
1109="I figured out I could find cockroaches in the garbage cans. But to get them, I need to get access. I think the easiest way is to get some work in the kitchen."
1110="Go to the canteen"
1111="A hefty thug, called Zach, was in charge of the kitchen. He had huge paws and the neck of a bull. So, better not to quarrel with someone like Zach."
1112="Work as a bean"
1113="Zach quickly endorsed my candidacy. My first job was to take out the trash. As I was busy near the garbage cans, I managed to find a hole that may someday help me get out of here. But I have a different task now."
1114="Catch a cockroach"
1115="I managed to catch a hefty cockroach. Then I pulled off my sock, put my new whiskered pal inside and put the sock in my belt. Once upon a time I was the most respected safecracker, and now I catch cockroaches. Life is an interesting thing."
1116="Go back to the kitchen"
1117="While convicts were busy, I quietly threw the cockroach into my bowl of soup."
1118="Make a scene"
1119="I was brawling for half an hour, but inmates didn't bat an eye. Seems like I lack charisma. I should [green] learn the prison slang [/ green] or [green] attend acting technique classes [/ green]."
1120="The shit hit the fan. The sparks began to fly! Everybody came runining here, even that old one-legged convict from laundry room. When there were enough people around I said: \n "That's Fang's fault!" A hush fell over the room"
1121="Play dead"
1122="Stand your ground"
1123="Zach came from the kitchen pushing his way through the crowd with his paws. He leaned over me, glared at me and hissed: "You have complaint, scum?""
1124="Throw a challenge"
1125="Hush up"
1126="I opened my mouth to say something, but Zach without delay lifted my ass off the chair with one hand, and stroke me in the jaw with the other. I pulled myself together in my cell, my dome was bursting, but, at least, now I know who is Fang. So, I need to find out who has the other two figurines."
1127="While I was jogging in the yard, I noticed a hefty fellow, who was working out in the gym. He had a tattoo of a dragon on his back. I remembered Harry saying that one of the figurines was taken by force. Perhaps this big fellow with the dragon tattoo had something to do with this story. To snoop around what was going on, I have to go to the gym and get acquainted with him."
1128="Go to the gym"
1129="The gym was stuffy and smelled with sweat. Is there anybody who wants to come here of his own free will? I looked around. Nobody here."
1130="Walk through the gym"
1131="Suddenly I've heard a quiet clanking sound from the deep of the gym. Seems like there is somebody. I walked closer and saw that guy with dragon tattoo. He was puffing and blowing benching the bar. The bar buckled under the impressive weight of discs. What a strength!"
1132="Wait untill he finishes"
1133="Hide and watch him"
1134="After a while, the big guy finished his exercises and went to shower. I started to ponder over my next move. Even if this bully has nothing to do with the figurine I'm looking for, it would be useful to enlist his support."
1135="Come up to the bar"
1136="I quietly came up to the bar. There was a notebook lying next to it. The big thug in a clumsy handwriting recorded how many times and how much weight he benched today. According to the records, he always starts his workouts with a bench press."
1137="I heard a rustle and quickly turned around. Carlos was standing behind me. Seems like the Mexican saw me digging in Dan's belongings. "Do you want to slay Hulking Dan?" - Carlos asked, smiling."
1138="What if we cut a piece of rebar Hulking Dan uses to hang his heavy bar? Then fasten it with a duct tape. When he finishes the exercise and tries to place the bar on it, it will fall right on his head!"
1139="Does it bother you? "
1140="No, why? "
1141="Carlos smiled and shook his head. \n " If you cut a piece of rebar Hulking Dan uses to hang his heavy bar, it will fall right on his head,as soon as he tries to put the bar back! Comprende? " - Carlos winked at me and headed for the exit."
1142="Search for Dragon netsuke"
1143="It would be nice to ingratiate with local strongmen. In order to do this I have to gain weight, coz some convicts still call me 'feeble'. I don't give a damn what they're talking about me, but having no respect amongst convicts it's difficult to obtain information. So, early in the morning I can [green] go jogging [/ green], [green] go to the playground [/ green] or [green] work out at the gym [/ green]."
1144="Now I have everything to make trick with this thug and a bar, so I need to know the exact time when he comes to the gym. I decided to follow him."
1145="Follow Hulking Dan"
1146="I came across the thug right next to the gym. He was standing there with some feeble and blabbered about life."
1147="Sneak up a bit closer"
1148="Get around back"
1149="I was close enough to hear the conversation. Thug was telling he was used to go to the gym every day at 10 am. And he demanded the feeble to clean his clobber like every time. I checked my watch. It's half an hour till training. I'm short of time. What should I do?"
1150="Sneak into the gym"
1151="Slightly open the gym door"
1152="Fine. I'll return as soon as I rustle up some cigs."
1153="The gym was empty. I approached the bench, took out the pincers and cut the rebar with great effort. I hate myself for doing this but it's the only way to save my wife."
1154="Get the duct tape"
1155="Check if no one's coming"
1156="I listened closely to the sounds in the hallway to make sure it was quiet. I can start now. I carefuly rolled up the cut segment of a rebar with the duct tape. I don't wanna give myself away so I attached the duct tape on the other side of a reber as well to make it look symmetrical. It was then when I heard the sound of heavy footsteps in the hallway."
1157="Hide in the shower"
1158="Hide in the locker room"
1159="Suddenly the door flew open and I saw Big Dan strolling inside the gym. He was waving his giant arms while stretch. Should my plan fail he'll break my spine with these very arms. Time went on as I was waiting for Dan to get to the barbell."
1160="Peek through the keyhole"
1161="Hulking Dan held the barbell on his outstreched arms. He slowly pulled it to his chest and then pushed it back with a pant. I started counting every push: one… two…"
1162="Leave the hiding shelter on the 8th push"
1163="Leave the shelter on the 10th push"
1164="Leave the shelter on the 12th push"
1165="I could barely move my feet because of anxiety. My vision was blurred. I got to Hulking Dan right when the barbell was falling on his head. I saw the horror in his eyes."
1166="Hold the barbell"
1167="Throw the barbell on the floor"
1168="At first Dan didn't grasp what happened. He then looked around, bursted out with anger and started hurling weights around the gym. All in all he flew into a tantrum. While he swore to tear apart whoever was behind this, I saw a netsuke on his neck. It was a Dragon on a leather strap."
1169="Calm Dan down"
1170="Sit quietly and wait"
1171="Finally, Dan calmed down a bit. He walked to me and and reached out his hand. "Thanks, bro! They call me Hulking Dan"."
1172="Boyd"
1173="I'm Eddie. You're lucky I was nearby"
1174="So, I managed to become a bro with the owner of the second netsuke. Now I just have to find the owner of the third one."
1175="Look for the Rat netsuke"
1176="While playing cards I learned about the prison Vegas. A true gambler's heaven. Dan, my new bro, promised to share some booze with me if I join him there. I concluded that a lot of dough can be made there. Plus it will be a perfect opportunity to find the third netsuke! I should [green]make a move[/green] in the evening!"
1177="The winning streak in vegas earned me quite a sum! One guy decided to play big and staked 60 cigs. Perhaps, If I'm lucky enough I'll find something about the third netsuke."
1178="Play big!"
1179="I need to hoard some cigs first"
1180="I'll pass"
1181="Schmucks took me to a closet near the kitchen where some big fish had already been waiting for me. I took a seat at the table and the bossy looking fella started dealing the cards."
1182="I noticed a scrawny guy in front of me who was fiddling rat figurine with his hands. It was the third netsuke! The scrawny guy looked me in the eyes, his mouth grinned. "A charm I won not so long ago. Brings me luck.""
1183="We started playing but I ran out of cigs pretty fast. These scammers outdid me as if I was a little girl! At least I know who's got the third netsuke and so far it seems the only way to get it is to win it from Scrawny."
1184="Finally I got my turn to use the phone booth. Having made sure no one was listening, I dialed Harry's number. There was no answer from the other side for a while but then I suddenly heard…"
1185=""Hey, bro? Haven't heard from you in a while. Your chick and us have gotten real anxious you know.""
1186="I know who's got netsuke"
1187="Let me talk to my wife!"
1188=""I knew we could count on you. Now the only thing you've got to do is to steal those figurines and bring them to me. I'll release your chick on my part. Hell, I'll even top it off with some dough for all the trouble. Anyway, I'll send a courier to ya tomorrow. Make sure he won't leave empty-handed."\n Holy shit, does Harry really think that everything's so damn easy?"
1189=""Easy, man. She's havinga ball. Now the only thing you've got to do is to steal those figurines and bring them to me. I'll release your chick on my part. Hell, I'll even top it off with some dough for all the trouble. Anyway, I'll send a courier to ya tomorrow. Make sure he won't leave empty-handed."\n Holy shit, does Harry really think that evrything's so damn easy?"
1190="Make the rules"
1191="Tell the deal to Harry"
1192=""Listen, Harry… If I just steal those figurines then I'm a goner. I need to come up with an escape plan first, only then I'll do the deed. After I get out we'll conduct the exchange.""
1193=""Ok bro, have it your way. But keep in mind that you're running out of time. I'll send your wife to you piece by piece should you let me down.""
1194="Recollect what happened before"
1195="Get instructions from Harry over the phone"
1196="Find the phone booth to contact the Mob"
1197="Get the phone card"
1198="Find the Cat figurine's owner"
1199="Find the Dragon figurine's owner"
1200="Find some pincers"
1201="Find some duct tape"
1202="Find the Rat figurine's owner"
1203="Pincers can be rustled up while working in a workshop. But first I must try to get a job there."
1204="While working I got the opportunity to snatch some pincers."
1205="Steal the pincers."
1206="I managed to hide the pincers in my uniform. Guards didn't notice anything and didn't even think of searching me when I was leaving the workshop."
1207="I tried to sneak out the pincers in a small box but the guards decided to search me through on my way out. I played dumb and said that I must have forgotten to put them out. I managed to avoid punishment but I've got to be more careful from now on."
1208="While walking in the yard I saw something in the grass near the fence. After getting closer I noticed it was a phone card. This would definitely come in handy."
1209="Make friends with Dan"
1210="To pull off this trick with Hulking Dan I'll need a pair of pincers and some duct tape. I can buy some duct tape if I [green]go to the Haggler[/green]. It's getting the pincers where troubles start. I could try to [green]sign up for prison labour[/green] as a janitor and then try to steal the pincers from the closet. Let's get to it!"
1211="Look for a phone card"
1212="If I wanna call Harry I'll need a phone card. Perhaps I should [green]talk with inmates[/green] or [green]hang around the prison[/green] a bit more if I want to find out where to get one."
1213="Chance"
1214="Carlos continued: "They call me ""Stashes"". Obviously it's because I know how to get in and hide contraband. That's what I did outside and that's what I continue doing inside.""
1215="Eddie"
1216="Eddie Boyd. Jewelry stealing"
1217="Well, buddy, make yourself comfortable. From what I know offecer Terner has already given you a brief on what's what so you can handle yourself."
1218="And here I am in the phone booth queue again. Some thug was screaming at the handset on top of his voice, blaming his half for hanging out with some rapper fellow. It took such a long time that I was about to strangle this would-be Simpson but suddenly he hanged up the phone and left. I picked up the handset and dialed Harry's number."
1219="Harry?"
1220="Harry was stretching out words in his mocking manner as usual: "Hi there, Eddie. Me and Sarah were thinking you won't call us any more. Have you got some joyous news to share?""
1221="Everything's done"
1222="I'm getting out soon"
1223="""Listen closely, my friend. The moment you're out of prison run straight to the road. There will be a cliff on your way which you'll have to get around using the trailway on the northern side. When you get down run to the road again: my man will be waiting for you in a car there. He'll get you to Sarah."""
1224="Cops will be on the lookout for me"
1225="I'll need new ID's"
1226=""Chill out, bro: I've got a fresh pair of fake ID's waiting for you and your wife. Both of you will get to Canada at my expense. Just get me those netsuke and we're even.""
1227="I hanged up the phone and got to my cell. All I could think of was Sarah and the way I could steal the netsuke from the inmates. When I got to the crib Carlos glanced at me as if he knew what was going on in my head. "
1228="Steal the cat netsuke"
1229="I was thinking about the best means of getting to the Fang's stash and my choice fell on ""knock him out while he's at the kitchen"" way. He's quite a big guy so I'll need a whole bottle of whiskey and a pack of dope. If I mix them up it'll be enough to knock out a raging bull. I might as well buy both whiskey and the dope if I [green]go to the Haggler[/green]."
1230="Mix whiskey with the dope"
1231="I'll leave it for later"
1232="I got a splendid cocktail by mixing whiskey with some strong dope. Now I need to get this stuff to Fang. "
1233="Head for the kitchen"
1234="As expected, Fang was hagning out with his pals at the kitchen. I was quite reknown here so I got to him without any questions. "
1235="Put the bottle of sleeping booze on the table"
1236="Pour the sleeping booze in their cups"
1237=""Damn, bro!" exclaimed the surprised inmates. They emptied their cups in no time and shortly afterwards the whole gang was lying on the floor snoring. "
1238="I need to act fast and find where he's hiding the netsuke."
1239="Ransack Fang's pockets. "
1240="I ransacked Fang's pockets but found nothing. I need to search further as time is running out. "
1241="Search through Fang's closet"
1242="There was a big safe right on the closet's floor. I inspected it and it became clear that I wouldn't open it without a key."
1243="Examine the ""Lion's Fang"" pendant"
1244="Immediately after taking the ""Lion's Fang"" in my hands I concluded that it was in fact a container. A couple of neat moves and a key fell out of the container."
1245="Run to the closet"
1246="I inserted the key into the safe and turned it, my hands were shaking with anxiety. With every turn my heartbeat increased as well. Having opened the door I noticed the cat netsuke amid the papers. "
1247="With inmates still snoring on the floor I went back to my cell, holding the cat netsuke in my hand. On my way I stumbled on a white-haired inmate named Paulson. He glanced at the netsuke in my hand and went towards the shower block quickly. Some time ago I heard from one guy that Paulson was a squealer. Just perfect! I need to be carfeul now."
1248="I need to get ready before going on such a serious job."
1249="Cat netsuke"
1250="Dragon netsuke"
1251="Rat netsuke"
1252="I approached the phone booth. An inmate was talking on the phone but he abruptly finished his talk and went off the moment he saw me. For the first time I don't have to wait in order to call Harry! "
1253="I know this number by heart already. When I get outside the first thing I'm gonna do is get rid of this tattoo, but for now I need to deal with all of this crap."
1254="Listening to the ringback tone felt like an eternity. At last someone picked up the phone on the other side. ""It's Boyd"" I said. "
1255=""I hope you were a good boy, Eddie?" I closed my eyes as I imagined hitting Harry's satisfied face. This thought alone made me smile. "I've got the goods" I replied."
1256="We stick to the plan? "
1257="How's Sarah?"
1258=""You know that I'm the man of my word. A black Dodge will be waiting for you. Behave yourself with the driver: he's a bit edgy. And he doesn't like surprises either...""
1259="There'll be no surprises"
1260="I'm a man of my word too "
1261=""Good, Eddie, very good! It'll be over soon. I have my trust in you." Harry hanged up the phone. I took some time listening to the busy tone thinking about how my wife's life depended on that bastard. "
1262="But this nightmare will be over soon. I just need to break out of this jail. "
1263="Start the jailbreak "
1264="It seems my adventures in this prison are coming to an end. I just need to wait till the night comes so I could escape undetected. "
1265="I decided to check my stash but Lil' Johnny was hanging out nearby so I had to wait till he went off. Once I was alone I wrapped the figurines in a rag and hid them under my shirt. "
1266="I went round the car and took the front passenger's seat. "
1267="Where's Sarah?"
1268="Put the figurines in the pocket"
1269="Harry gave a sign to a gorilla to his left who then opened a door of one of the cars and I saw Sarah inside. Her hands were tied, she was clearly scared but she was smiling at me. My Sarah... She hasn't changed a bit. I swear I'll never leave her alone. ""She's here and she's dying to see you. Give me the netsuke and do anyting you want with your wife. Witihn the boundries of decency, of course."""
1270="Hug Sarah"
1271="What's going on?"
1272="Harry grinned after noticing the look on my face. ""I'm not a big fan of art, Boyd. In fact I don't give a flying fuck 'bout these netsuke. But I do care a lot 'bout what's hidden in them."" And with these words he picked up three objects from the rubble. Those were portable memory cards. "
1273="Sarah stood, hugging me. I felt her hand slipping down my back and finding the gun. This is our only chance of salvation. ""Wait! - I shouted to Harry - Let me tell you a parable about a hare""\nHarry and the rest of the bastards started laughing. My mouth went dry. I felt Sarah pulling my gun ... And I put my right hand behind my back."
1274="Shoot Harry"
1275="Escape through the tunnel"
1276="Having got out of the prison, I dashed directly to the place where Harry's driver had to be waiting for me. I was struggling through the bushes, and soon both my hands and my face were all covered with deep abrasions. While going downhill I fell and, having slid on my belly, I cracked my head on the stone. I felt my head bleeding. I've got to hurry up. But should I not bandage my head up?"
1277="Treat the wound"
1278="I tore off a piece from my prison uniform, quickly made a band aid, and put it onto the wound. The bleeding has stopped for a while, and now I can run further."
1279="Keep running"
1280="I don't care about bleeding. I gotta get to Sarah as soon as possible."
1281="I pulled myself up and I ran faster. There were light beams ahead of me. The road is close! I looked through the bushes and saw a black Dodge parked there. Well, for now Harry is keeping his word. I walked over to the car. One of the Harry's thugs was behind the steering wheel. He saw me and started the car."
1282="Sit in the car"
1283="Check if there's no tail"
1284="I listened carefully. Everything was quiet. No howling sirens, no shouting, no dogs barking. It seems that my disappearance went unnoticed. I got into the car."
1285="We pulled away. My driver didn't seem to notice me. Like most people working for Harry, this one turned out to be a thug with a brick instead the face. Having thought for a while, I asked:"
1286="I took the gun and pulled the trigger. But there was no shot. I pulled the trigger again and again, but there were no shots, only clicks."
1287="Is my wife alright?"
1288=""Harry, let Sarah go. She's only guilty in saying yes to me a long time ago...""
1289="Where are we going?"
1290="Fight to the death"
1291="Why do you need Japanese figurines?"
1292="I got ready to kill anyone who'd come close to me or Sarah. If we fight, they'll kill us quickly."
1293="My driver did not even look at me. I did not insist. Soon I'll find out everything. If I stay alive, of course."
1294="Half an hour later we arrived at an abandoned gas station. I realized that my journey was over. Not far from that place there were a few cars, all Dodges and Chevrolet, it looked like someone had robbed a filming location in a  movie of 70s. I hope that one of these cars will fall on Harry's head."
1295="Step out of the car"
1296="Sit back"
1297="The driver turned to me and said "Get out of here, asshole!" It looks like I don't have any other option whatsover."
1298="I stepped out of the vehicle and made a few steps forward. Headlights blinded me for some moments. I heard someone's steps in front of me. As I looked closer, I saw a familiar face. It was Harry him-freaking-self. ""Here is our man!"" - he shouted and clapped his hands. "I hope you missed me the same way I missed you.""
1299="Keep netsukes"
1300="I didn't move. Harry's goons pointed their guns at me. Harry stopped smiling. "Stop fooling around, Boyd. Where are netsukes?""
1301="Give Harry netsukes "
1302="I fetched a roll with netsukes from my bosom and gave it to Harry. Harry snatched it away, unpacked it and burst into laughing. ""Thay are all here. - Harry kept on laughing like crazy. - Damn, Boyd, you did it. You saved my ass."" Harry released Sarah and pushed her in my direction. "
1303="I took Sarah into my arms. My heart pounded. I smelled her hair and it felt like the world had stopped. So many times I pictured this moment and dreamt of holding her in my arms like this. But it was too early to celebrate the family reunion. I took Sarah's hand and turned to Harry. "
1304="I made the job done"
1305="Where are our papers?"
1306="Look at Harry"
1307="Harry nodded, but it looked like he didn't hear me at all. "Harry, - I made sure my voice sounded as calm as possible. - What about your part of the agreement?" But Harry ignored me and put netsukes on the ground. Then he fetched a hammer from the trunk of his car, came to netsukes and started smashing them with the hammer."
1308=""What the hell are you doing""
1309="Say nothing"
1310="Harry kept on hitting the netsuked until they turned into brash. I couldn't believe my eyes. He destroyed what I 'd been risking my life for. "
1311="What's on those cards?"
1312="I looked at Harry lying dead on the ground. He had a shell hole between his eyes. Those guys who saved us were obviously pros. But what's gonna happen to us?"
1313="What's next? Can we go?"
1314="How did those cards get into netsukes?"
1315=""Oh Boyd... You've always been a dumbass, but this time you outdid yourself. Just do the math. Why should I keep the eyewitnesses?" - Harry said and pointed his gun at me. They say your whole life floats before your eyes in the moments like this. But I could only think of how incredibly stupid I was indeed. How could I trust a bustard like this?"
1316="Tell a parable"
1317=""There once was a hare, who did not believe that there are any hunters in the world. Only when the hare met them in the woods, he realized that they really existed. But it was too late." Harry waited for an ending, but I said nothing more. "Did you like my story, Harry?" - "No, Boyd, that was a shitty story." Meanwhile Sarah cocked the pistol and put the gun into my hand. "Too bad, Harry. I was hoping you would be grateful to the hunter, who told you the parable.""
1318="Run away"
1319="I took Sarah by the hand and started running. But one of the gunmen stopped the way."
1320="Throw a gun at Harry"
1321="I threw the gun at Harry, but he ducked down and the gun flew past. "
1322="Harry's goons jumped on me. One of them knocked me down, another one kicked me a couple of times until I almost blacked out. When they left me alone, I noticed Sarah sitting next to me. I knew they were gonna end us. "I'm so sorry, babe" - I whispered. Sarah smiled at me. "At least we tried" - she said. "
1323="Get up "
1324="Smile vanished from Harry's face. "I planned on killing you and your chick swiftly. But I changed my mind. I'll let my boys kick back.""
1325="Try to negotiate "
1326="Harry was about to shoot me. ""Die, you piece-of-shit!"" I hugged Sarah and closed my eyes..."
1327="And then something strange happened. I was deafened by the gunfire. Harry's men fell on the ground. I turned around and saw a dozen of camuflauged enforcers coming out of woods. "
1328="We raised our hands. One of the soldiers came to Harry and took three memory cards from his hand. "Check them!" - he said to another soldier. "This one is a Commander" - I thought. Our eyes met. "Eddie Boyd. I've heard a lot about you. - he said smiling at me. - You must be perplexed. Don't worry. Now you are safe."" 
1329="Who are you?"
1330="What's happening?"
1331="What do you want?"
1332=""Those cards contain valuable information for the people I work for. There are lots of juicy details of some prominent public officials covering criminals like this one ." - the Commander pointed at Harry. - Almost everyone who investigated this case was murdered. But we plan on bringing this info to public."
1333="Steal the dragon figurine"
1334="To get the dragon figurine I'll need a distraction, a pair of scissors and a little bit of luck. Scissors is no problem. I need to go to [green]work in the library [/green] and I'll be able to steal scissors from there. But how can I possibly make Hulking Dan not notice my cutting off the figurine from his neck? I gotta do something really smart. I need to find out what Dan's weakness is. I've noticed Hulking Dan getting special meals in the canteen. I gotta find out why. I should go to [green]work in the kitchen[/green]."
1335="Great, I've found out what Dan's weak spot is. Now I have to use this against him. I gotta recruit an accessory. Carlos seems a suitable candidate, but he is not gonna help me for free. I think 50 cigs might be enough to get my amigo interested in helping me. I need to talk to him."
1336="Persuade Carlos"
1337=""This shit is dangerous, mi amigo. If you want me to risk my ass for you, you'll have to pay. I'll take 50 cigs for that." Of course I didn't want to say goodbye to my cigarettes, but I didn't have any other option."
1338="Pay him"
1339=""
1340="I don't know how he did it, but in a couple of hours my partner fetched me a protein bar containing nuts. There is no one like Carlos when it comes to contraband. Dan won't be able to say no to such a treat."
1341="Now I have an accessory, a protein bar and a pair of scissors, I need to figure out when and where I should do it. I think the gym is the right place. Carlos will give Dan the bar in the evening when he is excercising. When Dan gets sick, I'll cut the figurine off his neck. "
1342="Make sure Carlos is in"
1343="Carlos told me he would be in the gym in the evening after 6 p.m. But if things go south, I'll have to pay Carlos some more cigs. "
1344="Looks like I have no choice"
1345="We shook hands and Carlos went away. Honestly, I didn't like this plan, but there weren't too many ideas to chose from. I was running out of time. Someone could easily disclose my tunnel. "
1346="The time came. I went to the gym. Carlos was there. He traded the protein bar for a couple of cigs. Dan ate the bar and in a few minutes he felt really sick. His whole face swelled up. Dan dropped to his knees and started gasping. He was suffocating."
1347="Call out for help"
1348="I shouted: ""Someone! Help! He can't breath!"" When everyone rushed out of the gym, I cut off the netsuke with the scissors. "
1349="Cut off the netsuke"
1350="While Dan was writhing in pain, I took the scissors and cut off the netsuke from Dan's neck."
1351="I got the figurine from Dan and then shouted to Carlos to get out. The mexican didn't even move a muscle. He knelt over the Dan's body. Poor fellow, he couldn't breathe, and Mexican also holded his hands over his mouth and nose. I stopped dead. ""What the hell are you doing?"" ""I have a bone to pick with this freak. Get lost. "" - spit out Carlos through gritted teeth."
1352="Try to stop Carlos"
1353="I rushed over to Carlos, but a moment later he was holding a shiv in his right hand. ""Better not stand in my way, mi compañero."" Carlos was bigger and stronger than me, holding weapons."
1354="That wasn't the deal!"
1355=""I've done my part. Now, get out!""
1356="You used me!"
1357=""Mi compañero, if you still haven't understood, using others is the only way to survive in East Castle.""
1358="Don't kill him!"
1359=""And this is not your business, mi compañero""
1360="I gave up. I walked out of the room and closed the door. The hallway was dark and silent. I knew that in a few moments Dan would be dead and his death would be on me. I will remember this day for the rest of my life. The day when Eddie Boyd became a murderer. Even the fact that I just needed to get the last netsuke didn't ease the pain."
1361="Steal the rat figurine"
1362="It's time to get real now and get the last figurine that I need. I must make move and play some cards in our mini Las Vegas. That should be the easiest way to get it. Folks say that it ain't a place for suckers and the minimum bet for a game is 350 cigarettes."
1363="There's a rumor that Scrawny is a greedy fuck. He once lost all of his stuff to a fella because he just couldn't stop. Lucky me. As we say here in prison, greed killed a dupe. I doubt that he'll pass on a big game if I bet, say, 350 cigarettes. But anything can happen at high stakes like this one so I should keep my eyes open."
1364="Knock at Scrawny's door"
1365="Leave it till later"
1366="I thought that I wasn't ready to compete with that ghoul, and decided to return to my cell."
1367="I knocked on the door and a few seconds later a freaking giant opened it. He stared at me and then yelled: "The fuck you want, huh?""
1368="Show him the cigs"
1369="Huh?"
1370="The damn giant went toward me and tried to reach me with his gorilla arms but I managed to step aside and quickly pulled out my stash of cigs. Seems like these guys aren't bright enough and don't have a sense of humor."
1371="The big guy nodded and let me in. I walked inside and a managed to make only a few steps before I almost got strangled by a cloud of cigaratte smoke. The smoke was so thick that I barely saw a large table in front of me. Scrawny was sitting by."
1372="The rat netsuke was right there, on the table. Scrawny was gazing at me and when my eyes got used to the smoke around us I noticed a few tough looking fellas in the corners of the room. You don't need to be a genius to understand that those guys will tear me apart if Scrawny tells them to. What's next?"
1373="I wanna play big"
1374="At first, it seemed, that Scrawny thought he was dealing with some sort of a sucker he usually played against. When he heard about the high stakes on a big game, he perked up.\n""Your bet?"" - he asked."
1375="All-or-nothing"
1376=""You're a brave fella, are you? Pity, that you'll soon be out of smokes, mate. I deal." Scrawny dealt the cards. We played a few rounds and I was lucky as ever. I won this one. I was just about to take my winnings when suddenly Scrawny put his skinny paw on them. "Not so fast, laddie. One more round""
1377="Alright, but you bet the rat netsuke"
1378=""Ah, that's why you came here, slyboots, - Scrawny stared at me for a while with his little gray eyes. "So be it. I bet my netsuke and you put 700 cigarettes. Deal?""
1379="No problem, bro."
1380="I won the game! Damn it, I got so lucky! Scrawny picked up the glass bottle that was covering the rat netsuke. He was barely holding his anger. He handed me the rat netsuke and said: "Take it and scram". His goons didn't take their eyes off me. Gotta leg it."
1381="I've lost everything! Lost 700 cigarettes. I must try to get the rat netsuke once again. Sarah's life depends on it!"
1382="While Fang, a senior in the kitchen, was twaddling with chums, I looked in the notes to the prison menu and found out that Hulking Dan was on a diet because of some health problems."
1383="To find out why Dan has earned a special ration, I need to [green] sign up for prison labor [/ green] as a janitor at the infirmary. I have to look at his medical records when the guards can't see me."
1384="During my work I was snooping around the infirmary. There were two guards hanging around, and I need to get inside unnoticed. Not an easy task but not that a big deal for me . I just need to keep my eyes open and try not to get caught. But what is the best way to sneak into the infirmary? Then I saw Lil' Johnny and Brainy Larry at the end of the corridor. Perhaps they can help me."
1385="Bribe the inmates"
1386="I gave a pack of cigarettes to each one of them and they set up a play to distract the guards. Without wasting any time I went inside the infiramry and searched for Hulking Dan's medical records. It was pretty easy to find them and I learned that he was allergic to nuts!"
1387="Risk it on my own"
1388="I managed to sneak past the guards and searched for Hulking Dan's medical records. I found them and learned that he was allergic to nuts."
1389="It turned out the guards were quick-eyed devils. One of them bend my hand when I was looking for Dan's medical records, and the other one punched me in the face. I have to try again later. At least after my nose stops bleedin'."
1390=""Your choices are few, bro. Either you trust me and do as I say or I'll send you Sarah's head in a box.""
1391=""The only guarantee is my word. Either you agree, or I'll send you Sarah's head in a box.""
1392="Why are you telling me this?"
1393="What's your interest?"
1394="Carlos did not answer, and a moment later he disappeared in the dark corridor. What if I do what Carlos said, but instead of killing Dan, I will save him from the falling weight? Then Dan will be in my debt, and I'll need friends like him."
1395="While I was playing ball on the sports ground, one of the inmates got interested in one of my tattoos. He was trying to recall what "Carpe Diem" means and where he could hear that phrase. I said that since I was a thief, this tattoo was something like a motto. While I was babbling on and on about how I had got it, someone has filched 5 cigarettes from my pocket. Damn, seems like someone actually seized the moment."
1396="As I've been working out, Lil' Johnny, a damn bull of a man, who was believed to be mentally retarded, came to me. Johnny grinned and asked me for a couple of cigarettes. The moment I tried to open my mouth to tell him I was short of cigarettes that day, Johnny stopped me and asked to listen to a parable."
1397="Listen to Lil' Johnny's parable"
1398=""There once was a hare, who did not believe that there were any hunters in the world. Only when the hare met them in the woods, he realized that they really existed. But it was too late." I waited for an ending or something but he just stared at me. Lil' Johnny continued to look me in the eyes, smiling.\n "Did you like my parable, Boyd?"\n"Yes."\n"Then, I think, you won't be so stingy with a couple of cigs for the hunter, who told you the parable."\nI didn't want to mess with this damn lunatic, especially since he was three times stronger than me, so I had to give Johnny three cigarettes."
1399="The security chief called me and said that one of the inmates had vomited near the infirmary. "Go out there and make it shine like my cat's balls! You got me, Boyd?" - He snapped out. I heard he once forced one of the inmates to clean a clogged toilet with bare hands, so I decided not to harp about my rights. Something went terribly wrong with my life... If I have to clean up some sucker's vomit..."
1400="Go to the infirmary"
1401="I picked up a mop, a bucket and a rag. There's like not much I can do about it. I went to the infirmary and noticed some inmates were trying to walk around a puddle of vomit on the floor. If I at least had a pair of gloves, cleaning all of this shit wouldn't be so disgusting."
1402="Ask for gloves in the infirmary"
1403="I looked inside. There was a pretty nurse sitting in the room. I briefly described the situation. Apparently she didn't give a damn about me, but eventually she gave me a pair of gloves, so that I'd get lost. Well at least it's something."
1404="Ask the guard for gloves."
1405="I went to talk to the bald guard, who was standing at the end of the corridor, and briefly described the situation. Apparently he wanted that disgusting slime on the floor to vanish as soon as possible, so he quickly threw me a pair of rubber gloves. Well at least it's something."
1406="I put on my gloves. Well, now I'm ready for cleaning."
1407="Start to clean the floor."
1408="I began to scrub the floor with the mop. I thought I'd throw up at least a dozen times while cleaning this shit but I actually managed to keep my breakfast. Other inmates looked at me with a sort of sympathy. I'm gonna spend at least a few hours in the showers when I'm done with this shit. Finally I managed to finish it somehow. ""Boyd!"" - the bald guard yelled at me. - 'Though you could keep the gloves, huh? Go wash them and bring them to the store room."" \n The store room! I can get some pincers there!"
1409="Go to the store room"
1410="I did everything the bald guard told me to. The pincers were waiting for me in a dark corner, behind the mops. I was so glad that I almost guffawed loudly."
1411="I managed to hide the pincers under my clothing and smuggle it past the guards. Whatever you say, sometimes you can find something good even in a pool of vomit."
1412=""One of our employees hid the memory cards inside the netsuke and gave them to his friend in prison, to secure the data. The mob and officials have a long reach, so all the information, including the investigation details, was destroyed. The memory cards stored in netsuke were the only hope to back these assholes against the wall. And, finally, these cards were in our hands.""
1413="What will happen to us?"
1414=""You did an excellent job, Mr. Boyd. Our organization is not concerned with the police, so we will not hinder your escape." I took Sarah's hand. Finally, we are free. Thoughts about our future started to appear in my mind. Finally, I can make plans! I immediately imagined me and Sarah drinking mojitos on a sunny beach somewhere in Mexico, buying our first house somewhere on the outskirts of Cartagena."
1415="Share my plan with Sarah."
1416="She laughed, and squeezed my hand even more. ""Mr. Boyd"" - the boss man called me. I turned around. He and one of his men, the one whom he gave the memory cards to, looked at me. ""Mr. Boyd, the memory cards that you gave Harry are empty. The real memory cards are still in East Castle. You'll have to come with us. """
1417="I don't know anything about it!"
1418="I'm not going back to prison!"
1419="He aimed his shotgun at me. ""Don't make me repeat myself, Mr. Boyd. Come with us if you want to live."""
1420="Relax in my cell"
1421="I was lying on the bunk, for the hundredth time going through my plan. Is there anything I missed? Is everything ready for the escape? ""Hey, compadre!"" - said Carlos from the upper bunk. A second later, I saw his face. He was holding an unfinished bottle of whiskey and handed it over to me."
1422="Take the bottle"
1423="I took a sip and felt a pleasant warmth spreading over my body. Carlos jumped off the bunk and sat down opposite me."
1424="I shook my head. Carlos smiled, finished the bottle, and then jumped off the upper bunk and sat down opposite me."
1425="""You hate me, amigo? - Carlos asked quietly. \n ""Yes, - I told him - But I hate myself even more "".\nCarlos nodded. ""This place makes people violent. You don't fit in this place, Boyd. And you know it."""
1426="What do you mean?"
1427="What do you know?"
1428=""It was hard not to notice how you are sniffing around those figurines. I have no idea what you need them for. But I know they will get you into big trouble. Everyone knows it was you who stole all those figurines. Those guys are figuring out what is the best way to end you. You gotta get out of here. Carlos won't be able to keep you safe.""
1429="Why should I trust you?"
1430=""Don't be stupid, Boyd. You can't trust anyone. But now you don't have any choice." Carlos gave me something wrapped in rags. I unwrapped the pack. There was a gun. "
1431="Where did you get it?"
1432="What's that for?"
1433="Why are you helping me?"
1434=""What difference does it make? When someone gives you hope you don't ask questions. You just say "thank you".""
1435="Take the gun"
1436=""Thank you"- I said and hid the gun in my robe. "I gotta go" - Carlos said. He reached his hand. I shook it but I was totally confused. Why is Carlos helping me? Why did he kill Hulking Dan? Where did he get the gun? I will never find the answers to these questions."
1437="To get the dragon figurine I'll need a distraction, a pair of scissors and a little bit of luck. The scissors are not a problem. I need to go to [green]sign up for prison labor[/green] in the library and I'll be able to steal the scissors from there. But how can I possibly make Hulking Dan not notice me cutting off the figurine from his neck? I gotta do something real smart. I need to find out what Dan's weakness is. I've noticed Hulking Dan getting special meals in the canteen. I gotta find out why. I should [green]sign up for prison labor [/green] in the kitchen as well."
1438="I finished digging the tunnel. I made sure everything was ready for the escape. I was really close to get my freedom back. To tell the truth, I even thought of escaping that very moment, but then I realized I didn't need any of it without Sarah. I returned to my cell. Now I have to get all three netsukes as soon as possible. "
